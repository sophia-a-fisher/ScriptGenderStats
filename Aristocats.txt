Singer: Which pets' address is the finest in Paris? Which pets possess the longest pedigree? Which pets get to sleep on velvet mats? Naturellement! The Aristocats! Which pets are blessed with the fairest forms and faces? Which pets know best all the gentle social graces? Which pets live on cream and loving pats? Naturellement! The Aristocats! They show aristocatic bearing. When they're seen upon an airing. And aristocatic flair in what they do and what they say. Aristocats are never found in alley ways or hanging around. The garbage cans where common kitties play. Oh, no! Which pets are known to never show their claws? Which pets are prone to hardly any flaws? To which pets do the others tip their hats? Naturellement! The Aristocats! Ho, ho, ho! Aristocats... [ Singing ln French ]

Georges Hautecourt: Will, eh? Will. Well.
[ Squeaking ]
Georges Hautecourt: Now, then, madame, who are the beneficiaries ?
Madame Adelaide Bonfamille: [offsceen] Well, as you know, my friend, I have no living relatives, and naturally, I want my beloved cats... to be always well whatever cared for. And certainly no one can do this better than my faithful servant, Edgar.
Georges Hautecourt: [voice] Edgar you say? Adelaide, madame, you mean to say... you're leaving your vast fortune to Edgar? Everything you possess? Stocks and bonds? This-- Well, this mansion? You know, your country chateau? Art treasures, jewels and--
Madame Adelaide Bonfamille: [voice] No, no, no, Georges. To my cats.
Georges Hautecourt: [voice] To your cats?
Edgar Balthazar: [Gasping] Cats?!
Madame Adelaide Bonfamille: [voice] Yes, Georges. I simply wish to have the cats inherit first. Then, at the end of their life span, my entire estate will revert to Edgar.
Edgar Balthazar: Cats inherit first! And I come after the cats. I, me, after-- No. It's not fair! Ow! I mean, oh, each cat will live about 12 years. I can't wait. And each cat has nine lives. That's four times twelve. Multiplied by nine times. No, it's less than that. Anyway, it's much longer than I'd ever live. I'll be gone. No. Oh, no. They'll be gone. I'll think of a way. Why, there are a million reasons why I should! All of them dollars. Millions. Those cats have got to go! [Tearing] Oh drat!
Berlioz: Wait for me! Wait for me!
Marie: Me first! Me first!

Toulouse: Huh, you're not a lady.
Berlioz: You're nothing but a sister!
Marie: Oh!
Toulouse: Ouch! You black!

Berlioz: Fight fair, Marie !
Toulouse: Females never fiight fair. Whoa!
Marie: Ow! Now that hurt. Mama! Mama!
Duchess: Marie, darling. Please, you must stop that. This is really not lady like. And, Berlioz, well, such behaviour... is most unbecoming to a lovely gentleman.
Berlioz: Well, she started it.
Marie: Ladies do not start fights, Buster, but they can finish them.
Duches: [offscreen] Berlioz, now don't be rude.
Berlioz: We were just practicing biting and clawing.
Duchess: Aristocrats do not practice biting and clawing... and things like that-- it's just horrible!
Toulouse: But you know what? Someday, we might meet a tough alley cat. [Snarling, Hissing]
[Duchess Laughs]
Toulouse: Kind like me I guess.
Duchess: Now that will do, honey. But right now it's time we concerned ourselves with self-improvement. Now, you want to grow up to be lovely, charming ladies and gentlemen. Now, Toulouse, you go and start on with your painting.
Toulouse: Yes, mama. [Hissing]
Marie: [offscreen] Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint... before we start our music lesson? Please ?

Marie: [offscreen, giggles] It's Edgar!
Berlioz: [offscreen] Yeah. Old picklepuss Edgar!

Berlioz: [sighs] It's really hard to pronounce your name, man.
Roquefort: It's not really hard, Berlioz. And I'm not a man either. You should pronounce my name correctly.
Berlioz: Just a nickname I gave you, "Roque-fort"?
Roquefort: That's it! You've got it! Now, just a few dunks. Mm. Ooh. Very good. My compliments to the chef.

O'Malley: No trouble at all, little princess. And when we get to Paris, I'll show you the time of your life.
Duchess: Oh, I'm so sorry, but, well, we just couldn't. You see, my mistress, she will be so worried about us.
O'Malley: Well, humans don't really worry too much about their pets.
Duchess: Oh, no! You just don't understand. She loves us very much. Our poor owner, in that big mansion where we lived, all alone. In all our days, in tender ways, her love for us was shown. And so, you see, we can't leave her alone. She'd always say that we're the greatest treasure she could own. Because with us she never felt alone.
Frou-Frou: Oh, Roquefort, I've been so worried about you. Did you have any luck at all?
Roquefort: Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou, and I've searched all night.
Frou-Frou: I know. And poor Madame didn't sleep a wink either.
Roquefort: Oh, it's a sad day for all of us.
[Humming]
Edgar Balthazar: Morning, Frou-Frou, my pretty steed. [Whispering] Can you keep a secret? Hmm? (outloud) Of course you can. [Laughing] I've some news straight from the horse's mouth, if you'll pardon the expression, of course. Look, Frou-Frou. I've made the headlines. " Mysterious Cat-napper Abducts Family of Cats." [Laughing] Aren't you proud of me?
Roquefort: [Whispering] So... he's the cat-napper!
Edgar Balthazar: The police say it was a professional, masterful job. The work of a genius. Not bad, eh, Frou-Frou old girl?
Frou-Frou: [Whinnying]
Edgar Balthazar: Oh, they won't find a clue to implicate me. Not one single clue at all. Why, I'll, I'll eat my hat if they-- My hat! My umbrella! Oh! Oh, gracious! I've got to get those things back tonight.
Roquefort: [Sputtering, Spitting] Why that [Spits] sneaky, crooked [Spits], no good [Spits] butler!
O'Malley: Anyone for breakfast?
Toulouse: What breakfast?
Marie: Where is it?
O'Malley: Right under that magic carpet. But now we have to cook up a little spell. You know. You ready? All right. First, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose... and tickle your chin. Now you close your eyes... and cross your heart. Then, presto! Breakfast, a la carte.
Marie: Hooray!
Toulouse: We did it!

O'Malley: Well, some humans are like that, Duchess. [offscreen] I've learned to live with 'em.
Toulouse: I'll show him. [Snarling, Hissing, Spitting ]
O'Malley: [offscreen] Hey, cool it, you little tiger. That guy's dynamite.
Toulouse: But he called us tramps!
Duchess: Oh, I'll be so glad when we get back home.
O'Malley: Well, that's a long way off, so we better get moving.
Toulouse: Gee whiz! Look at that bridge! Come on, guys. Let's play train.
Duchess: Now be careful, children.
Toulouse: Don't worry, mama, we will. Now, Marie's the caboose. All aboard! Choo-choo-choo, choo-choo.
Choo-choo-choo, choo-choo. Whoo-whoo! Choo-choo-choo-choo, choo-choo-choo-choo. Whoo-whoo! Clickety-clickety-clickety. Clickety. Whoo-whoo!
[Train Whistle Blowing]
Duchess: Oh, no!
O'Malley: [offscreen] All right. Now don't panic. [onscreen] Down underneath here.
Marie: Mama!
Duchess: Marie! Oh, Marie!
O'Malley: Keep your head up, Marie! Here I come!
Toulouse: Wait for us, mama!
Duchess: Thomas! Thomas, up here!
Toulouse: Gee, Marie, why'd you have to fall off the bridge?
Duchess: Thomas? Oh, Thomas! Take care!
O'Malley: I'm all right, Duchess, honey. Don't worry. I'll see ya down stream.
Amelia: What beautiful countryside, Abigail. So much like our own dear England.
Abigail: Oh, indeed, yes, sis. Amelia, if I walk much farther... I'll get flat feet.
Amelia: Abigail, we were born with flat feet.
[Laughing]
Abigail: I say. Look over there.
Amelia: [offscreen] Oh. Oh, how unusual.
Abigail: [offscreen] Fancy that, a cat learning how to swim.
Amelia: And he's going about it all the wrong way.
Abigail: Quite. We must correct him.
Amelia: Sir. Sir? You are most fortunate we happened along.
Abigail: Yes. We're here to help you.
O'Malley: No, no. Back off, girls. I'm doin' fine!
Abigail: So first, you must gain self-confidence... by striking out on your own.
O'Malley: Go away! I'm tryin' to get to shore.
Amelia: You will never learn to swim properly with that willow branch in your mouth.
Abigail: Indeed not!
Amelia: Snip, snip. Here we go.
O'Malley: Don't do that!
Abigail: You're doing it splendidly.
Amelia: And don't worry about form, sir. It will come later. Alright?
O'Malley: [Gasping] Alrighty, whatever. I'm still tryin' to get to SHORE!
Abigail: He takes to water like a fish, doesn't he? A very enthusiastic--
[ Shrieking ]
Amelia: No! Now, this is no time for fun and games.
[Laughing]
[ Laughing Fades ]
Abigail: Gracious me. You don't suppose--
Amelia: Oh, yes. Yes, I do. Bottoms up !
Together: Deeper!
Toulouse: Look, Mama. There he is.
Abigail: You really did quite well for a beginner.
Duchess: Oh, Thomas! Thank goodness you're safe!
O'Malley: I am, babe.
Abigail: Keep practicing.
Amelia: And toodly-pip !
Toulouse: Is there anything we can do to help you, Mr. O'Malley, huh ?
O'Malley: [Gasping] Help? I've had all the help I can take.
Duchess: Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so much for helping Mr. O'Malley.
Amelia: Of course, my dear. But first, introductions.
Abigail: Yes. We British like to keep things proper.
Abigail & Amelia: [Laughing]
Amelia: Now listen to this, I am Amelia Gabble, and this is my sister--
Abigail: Miss Abigail Gabble.
Amelia: We're twin sisters of couse.
Abigail: You might say we're related.
Abigail & Amelia: [Both Laughing]
Abigail: [offscreen] Oh, how silly!
Duchess Oh, how nice. I never would have guessed.
Berlioz: Look, guys! They got rubber feet.
Toulouse: Yeah.
Abigail & Amelia: [Both Laugh]
Duchess: Say, what brings you two here? You've just rescued Thomas, right?
Abigail: Silly you! We're on holiday. For a walking tour of France. Swimming, some of the way.
Amelia: On water, of course.
Duchess: Thomas, this is Amelia and Abigail Gabble. They're the one's who rescued you from drowning.
O'Malley: Yeah, honey. Get those two web-footed life guards outta here, okay?!
Duchess: Now, now, Thomas. Let's be nice to our new friends.
O'Malley: Okay. Okay, baby. Fine. Hiya, chicks.
Abigail: Oh!
Abigail & Amelia: [Both Laugh]
O'Malley: What, gals?
Abigail: We're not chickens. We're geese.
O'Malley: No. I thought you were swans.
Duchess: Thomas!
Amelia: You flatterer.
Abigail: You know, deary, your husband is very charming and very handsome.
O'Malley: Well, uh, you see... I-l'm not exactly her husband.
Amelia: "Exactly"? You either are or you're not.
O'Malley: All right gals... I'm not.
Abigail & Amelia: [Together] Oh? Hmm?
Amelia: It's scandalous. He's nothing but a cad. Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.
Abigail: A roue. [offscreen]  His eyes are too close together.
Amelia: Shifty too.
Abigail: And look at his crooked smile. His chin is very weak too. Obviously a philanderer who trifles with unsuspecting women's hearts.
Marie: How romantic!
Berlioz: Sissy stuff!
Marie: Grrr!
Duchess: [offscreen] Marie!
Marie: Sorry.
Duchess: Please, girls. Please, let me explain. Thomas is
a dear friend of ours. He's just helping us to get to--
O'Malley: Come on, Duchess. Come on. Let's get out of here.
Duchess: Thomas?
O'Malley: Well, girls, see ya around. We're on our way to Paris.
Abigail: Oh, how horribly nice! If we're going to Paris ourselves, why don't you join us?
Duchess: I think that's a splendid idea.
O'Malley: Oh, no. Not a bad idea.
Amelia: Now, ah, listen to our idea, you stand here, dear. And, uh, let's see. You take this position.
Abigail: Duchess, you'll do nicely here.
Amelia: Yes, very good.
Abigail: And you, dear, you take this place. Now that leaves Mr. O'Malley.
Amelia: Oh. We can't leave him, can we?
O'Malley: Fine.
Abigail: Mr. O'Malley, I think you should be the rear end. Ready, everyone? Now think "goose."
Amelia: Forward, march!
Berlioz: Mama, do we have to waddle like they do ?
Duchess: Yes, dear. Just think "goose."
Amelia: And by the way, when we get to Paris, you must meet Uncle Waldo.
O'Malley: "Waldo"? Who's that?
Amelia: Yes, that's a question. Waldo's our uncle.
Abigail: We are to meet him at Le Petit Cafe.
Duchess: Le Petit Cafe? Oh, that's that famous restaurant.
Amelia: Ah, c'est magnifique!
Uncle Waldo: [Squawking]
Le Petit Café Chef: Sacrebleu! Ow! Oh! He bit my finger! Get out! Go! Go on! Get out! Scram! [Offscreen] Good riddance.
Uncle Waldo: [Mumbling, Sighing & Hiccupping]
Amelia: Why-- Why it's Uncle Waldo !
Abigail: Uncle Waldo !
Uncle Waldo: [Screaming] Abigail! Amelia! [Laughing] My two favorite nooses!
Amelia: Uncle Waldo. I do believe you've been drinking.
Abigail: Oh, dear! What happened to your lovely tail feathers?
Uncle Waldo: Girls, it's outrageous! Why, you won't believe what they tried to do... to your poor old Uncle Waldo! [Hiccupping] Look. Look at this! It says here. [Reading] "Prime Country Goose a la Provencal. " "Stuffed with chestnuts"? "And basted in... [ Sniffles ] white wine." [ Hiccups ]
O'Malley: "Basted"? He's been marinated in it.
Uncle Waldo: Dreadful! Being British, I would have preferred sherry.
[ Laughing ]
Uncle Waldo: Sherry! Sherry.
- [ Laughing ]
Amelia: Oh ! Oh, oh--Oh, Uncle Waldo, you're just too much.
Abigail: You mean he's had too much.
- [ Laughing ]
Amelia: [ Whispering ] Abigail! Abby!
Abigail: Yes, yes?
Abigail: We best get Uncle Waldo to bed.
Uncle Waldo: Why, I say there, now. What's all the whis--whispering about, huh ?
Abigail & Amelia: [ Together] Shh, shh !
Uncle Waldo: [Laughter] Now, now, now, now. Girls. Girls! Don't shush your old Uncle Waldo! Why, you'll, you'll wake up the whole neighborhood!
Abigail & Amelia: Shh ! No !
Uncle Waldo: Whoopee ! Neighborhood ! [ Laughing ]
Abigail: Come to sleep, Uncle Waldo !
Amelia: Oh, yes, I think we'd better be going.
Uncle Waldo: Oh, righto, girls. Birds of a feather must [ Hic ] together.
Abigail & Amelia: [ Laughing ] [offscreen] That's stick together.
Abigail, Amelia & Uncle Waldo: [ Laughing ]
Uncle Waldo [ Singing ]
Abigail & Amelia: Shush, shush, shush !
- [ Waldo Continues Singing ]
- [ Abigail, Amelia Laughing ]
O'Malley: You know something? I like Uncle Waldo.
Duchess: Especially when he's marinated! [chuckling] Just like you say, Thomas.

Napoleon: Hush your mouth, you idiot. Let's see. They're Oxford shoes. Size nine-and-a-half. Hole in the left sole, it sounds like.
Lafayette: What color are they?
Napoleon: They're black--How would I know that? Hey, now the squeakin' has stopped.
Lafayette: I still say it was a little old cricket bug.
Napoleon: I'm the leader. I'll decide what it was. It was a little old cricket bug.
Lafayette: I'll see ya in the morning, Napoleon. [ Sighing ]
Napoleon: That's my hat. I'm the leader.
Lafayette: Well, shootfire, man. Don't get sore at me! I ain't done nothin'. [ Mumbling ]

Lafayette: Hey, Napoleon! Ooh, it's them shoes again.
Napoleon: Yeah, yeah, I hear 'em.
Lafayette: Napoleon, I'm plumb goose-pimply scared!
Napoleon: Now this is no time to turn chicken. Alright?
[ Grunting ]
Napoleon: I got a feelin' this case is gonna bust wide open.
Napoleon & Lafayette: [ Screaming ]
Lafayette: D-D-D-Did you see him ?
Napoleon: No, no. He sneaked up behind me and tailgated me.
Lafayette: Well, he didn't hurt me. He hit me on the head. [ Laughing ]
Napoleon: Shh! Listen !

Napoleon: Sounds like a one-wheel-- Ooh.
Lafayette: A one-wheel what ?

Marie: Mama, I'm tired.
Berlioz: Me too, and my feet hurt.
O'Malley: Look, baby, it's late, okay? You know the kids are bushed.
Toulouse: I'll bet we walked a hundred miles.
Berlioz: I'll bet it's more than a thousand.
Duchess: Now, now, darlings. Cheer up. Mr. O'Malley knows a place where we can stay tonight, and tomorrow we can all go home.
Toulouse: Good idea, mama. Hey, Mr. O'Malley, how much farther is it?
O'Malley: [ Chuckles ] Keep your whiskers up, Toulouse Ol'Tiger. It's just beyond that next chimney pot. Well, there it is. My own penthouse pad. It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's peaceful and quiet.

O'Malley: Oh! Oh, no. Sounds like Scat Cat and his gang have dropped by.
Duchess: Oh. Are those friends of yours?
O'Malley: Uh-huh, yeah. They're old buddies and they're real swingers.
Duchess: "Shwingers?" What is a it?

Toulouse: [offscreen] I told ya it was Edgar.
Berlioz: [offscreen] Aw, shut up, Toulouse.
Duchess: [offscreen] Berlioz, shh! Watch your mouth.
Madame Adelaide Bonfamille: Oh, it's no use, Edgar. I'm afraid it was just the imagination of an old lady. But I was so sure that I heard them.
Edgar Balthazar: I'm so sorry, Madame.
Roquefort: I've got to find him. Oh, that must be him! Mr. O'Malley ! [ Grunting ] Hey ! Stop !

O'Malley: [offscreen] Move ! [onscreen] Tell him O'Malley sent you and you won't have a bit of trouble.
Roquefort: [ Breathing Hard ] No trouble, he said. Well, that's easy for, uh, for what's-his-name to say. He's got nine lives. I've only got one.
Scat Cat: What's a little swinger like you doin' on our side oftown ?
Roquefort: Oh, please ! Uh, I was sent here for help by a cat.
Scat Cat: Why, this is outrageous & crazy !
[Cats Laughing]

Hit Cat: Keep talkin', mousy.
Roquefort: H-How about--O'... Grady ? Huh ?
Scat Cat: Mousy, you just struck out. [offscreen] Any last words ?
Roquefort: [ Muttering ] Why did I listen to that O'Malley cat!?
Scat Cat: O'Malley!?
All: O'Malley!?
Scat Cat: Hold it, cats ! This little guy's on the level.
Roquefort: You're darn tootin' I'm on the level !
Peppo: Oh, we didn't mean-a to, to rough a-you, squeaky !
Roquefort: Don't worry about me ! O'Malley needs help ! [offscreen] Duchess and the kittens are in trouble !
Scat Cat: Come on, cats ! We gotta split !
Roquefort: Hey, wait for me ! You don't know the way !
Wine Drinking Man: What's this?
Edgar Balthazar: [offscreen] Now, my little pesky pets. You're going to travel first class... [onscreen] in your own private compartment... [offscreen] all the way to Timbuktu. And this time, ha, you'll never come back. Oh, dear. But we've got to hurry. [onscreen] The baggage truck will be here any moment now.
[O'Malley pounces. The cat runs to the stable door and locks it. Frou-Frou grabs Edgar by the jacket. He tears himself free and forces the door open and falls over backwards. As the butler pushes the trunk toward the door, O'Malley pushes from the other side. The horse blocks the road. Waving a scythe, Edgar chases O'Malley up a ladder. It falls over, shrieking. Edgar stabs a mound of hay with a pitchfork. O'Malley runs and Edgar chases him. The cat cowers against the wall, shaking in fear. Edgar throws the pitchfork at him, hitting him against the wall. Edgar opens the door. He tries to shut it, but the alley cats attack]
O'Malley: Over there! They're in the trunk!
[Roquefort runs to the trunk and works on the combination lock. O'Malley pushes the pitchfork off with his hind feet, freeing himself. The alley cats attack Edgar]
Roquefort: Csendes!
[Roquefort spins the lock and it opens. O'Malley jumps into the trunk]
O'Malley: EVERYBODY OUT OF HERE, FAST!!
[Edgar shuts the lid]
Edgar Balthazar: You're going to [offscreen] Timbuktu... [onscreen] if it's the last thing I do!
[A cat drops a bale of hay onto Edgar. Two cats throw a harness from the hay loft, encircling him. Scat Cat tosses a bucket of water over Edgar's head. Another cat slides a hook under the harness.
