RAYA:
I know what you’re thinking. A lone
rider, a dystopian world, a land
that’s gone to waste - how did this
world get so broken? Well, that all
began 500 years ago.
Kumandra. This is what we used to
be, when our land was whole and we
lived harmoniously alongside
dragons - magical creatures who
brought us water and rain and
peace.
It was paradise.
But then, the druun came - a
mindless plague that spread like
wildfire - multiplying as they
consumed life and turned everyone
they touched into stone.
The dragons fought for us the best
they could, but it wasn’t enough.
That’s when the mighty Sisudatu,
the last dragon, concentrated all
her magic into a gem and... 
... blasted the druun away.
Everyone that was turned to stone
came back... except the dragons.
All that was left of Sisu was her
gem.
It should have been this big
inspirational moment where humanity
united over her sacrifice... but
instead - people being people -
they all fought to possess the last
remnant of dragon magic.
Borders were drawn. Kumandra
divided. We all became enemies. And
the gem had to be hidden.
But that’s not how the world broke.
That didn’t truly happen until 500
years later when I came into the
story...

YOUNG RAYA:
(humored)
Looks like someone’s trying to be
clever. Alright, Tuk-Tuk, let’s show ’em
what clever really looks like.
Tuk-Tuk! Come on. Focus. 
Thank you.
Hey, bud. That was awesome. Gimme
some shell.
I gotcha. Wait a second... this feels too
easy...
Chief Benja. Look, I know it’s your
job to try and stop me, but you
won’t.

BENJA:
Don’t mistake spirit for skill,
young one. I promise you will not
set foot on the Dragon Gem’s inner
circle. Not even a toe.

YOUNG RAYA:
You might want to take out that
blade. You’re gonna need it.

BENJA:
Not today.
BOOP.
Like I said, not one foot on the
inner circle. You lost, Raya.

YOUNG RAYA:
(smug)
Did I?

BENJA:
(with seeming pride)
Raya... (but in reality)
... I probably should have said two
feet. 

YOUNG RAYA:
Hey. Don’t beat yourself up too
much, Chief Benja. You gave it your
best.

BENJA:
I won’t. And it’s either father or
ba to you.
(smiles)
You did good, dewdrop.
(with great affection)
You passed the test. 

YOUNG RAYA:
Wow. The spirit of Sisu.

BENJA:
For generations, our family has
sworn to protect the gem. Today,
you will join that legacy.
Raya, Princess of Heart, my
daughter. You are now a Guardian of
the Dragon Gem. 
Well, someone’s excited.

YOUNG RAYA:
Anyone hoping to steal the dragon
gem now has to face the fury of the
TWO baddest blades in all the
lands. 

BENJA:
(confidentially)
I’m glad you feel prepared,
dewdrop, because I have something
important to tell you - the other
lands... they’re on their way here
as we speak.

YOUNG RAYA:
They are? 
Okay, OKAY, we can do this. I’m
ready. I know exactly how we’ll
stop them.

BENJA:
(unconvinced)
Really? Tell me what you know about
the other lands. 

YOUNG RAYA:
First Tail. A sweltering desert
with sneaky mercenaries who fight
dirty. Second Talon. A floating market
famous for fast deals and fighters
with even faster hands.
Third Spine. A frigid, bamboo
forest guarded by exceptionally
large warriors and their giant
axes.
Fourth Fang, our fiercest enemy. A
nation protected by angry
assassins... and their even angrier
cats. Hisss!
Okay, so we’re gonna need
crossbows. And catapults. Ooo, what
about flaming catapults?

BENJA:
(adds ingredients)
Or... how about - Shrimp paste from
Tail, lemongrass from Talon, Bamboo
shoots from Spine, chilis from
Fang, and palm sugar from Heart.

YOUNG RAYA:
(confused)
We’ll poison them?

BENJA:
No, we’re not going poison them and
we’re not going to fight them.
We’re going to share a meal with
them.

YOUNG RAYA:
Wait, what? 

BENJA:
I invited them.

YOUNG RAYA:
But they’re our enemies.

BENJA:
They’re only our enemies because
they think the dragon gem magically
brings us prosperity.

YOUNG RAYA:
That’s ridiculous. It doesn’t do
that.

BENJA:
They assume it does just like we
assume things about them.
(offers a bowl of soup)
Raya, there’s a reason why each
land is named after a part of the
dragon. We were once unified
harmoniously as one. Kumandra.

YOUNG RAYA:
That’s ancient history, ba.

BENJA:
But it doesn’t have to be. Listen,
if we don’t stop and learn to trust
one another again, it’s only a
matter of time before we tear each
other apart. This isn’t the world I
want you to live in.
I believe that we can be Kumandra
again. But someone has to take the
first step. Trust me.

YOUNG RAYA:
(whispers)
Thing’s look a little tense, ba.

BENJA:
Don’t worry. I’m gonna open with a
joke.

YOUNG RAYA:
Please, don’t.

BENJA:
I’m kidding, I’m kidding.
People of Tail, Talon, Spine, and
Fang, welcome to Heart. For far too
long we have been enemies. But
today is a new day. Today, we can
be Kumandra once more.

TAIL CHIEF:
(extra-paranoid)
Nice speech, Chief Benja, but why’d
you really bring us here? Are you
gonna rob us?

DANG HAI:
(slightly drunk)
Why would he need to rob us? The
land of Heart already has
everything.

SPINE CHIEF:
It’s easy to pontificate on
Kumandra when you hold the
mightiest weapon in all the lands.

BENJA:
The gem’s not a weapon, it’s a
sacred relic.

YOUNG RAYA:
I have something to say...
Who’s hungry?

VIRANA:
(whispers)
Go ahead. It’s alright.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
I’m Namaari. Of Fang.

YOUNG RAYA:
Hi Namaari, I’m Raya.
Is that Sisu?!
(embarrassed)
Sorry. I might be a little bit of a
dragon nerd.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
Hey. I’m the one wearing the Sisu
fan-necklace.

YOUNG RAYA:
Come on. Have you eaten yet?
(mid-laugh)
Seriously? Your mom actually said
that? Awkward. 
Okay, next question - hand-to-hand
or swords?

YOUNG NAMAARI:
(duh)
Blades all day.

YOUNG RAYA:
Right?

YOUNG NAMAARI:
Okay... dressy or casual?

YOUNG RAYA:
Only a monster would choose to wear
this outfit on the regular.
Rice or stew?
I didn’t think that’d stump you.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
This is actually one of the first
times I’ve had rice in a while.

YOUNG RAYA:
Really?

YOUNG NAMAARI:
Fang may look nice on the outside,
but we have some pretty big holes
on the inside.

YOUNG RAYA:
Oh.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
Sorry, didn’t mean to bring it
down. So where were we? We both
have single parents who are
terrible at telling jokes, we’re
both warrior-women who despise
uncomfortable formal wear -

YOUNG RAYA:
- AND we’re both Sisu super fans.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
(hushed)
You know, Fang legend says she’s
still out there.

YOUNG RAYA:
Sisu? You’re kidding, right?

YOUNG NAMAARI:
Wanna see something? 

YOUNG RAYA:
(in awe)
Are you supposed to have that?

YOUNG NAMAARI:
(duh)
No.
According to this, after the Mighty
Sisu blasted away all the druun,
she fell into the water and floated
downstream. Legends say she’s now
sleeping at the river’s end.

YOUNG RAYA:
But which river? There’s like
hundreds.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
I don’t know. But if we could find
it, could you imagine? A dragon
back in the world? Things could be
so much better.

YOUNG RAYA:
(looks at her dad)
Yeah, maybe we really could be
Kumandra again.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
Here.

YOUNG RAYA:
Whoa. Really?

YOUNG NAMAARI:
From one dragon nerd to another.

YOUNG RAYA:
Hey. Come with me, dep la. I wanna
show you something.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
(sees the gem, in awe)
The spirit of Sisu. I can feel it.

YOUNG RAYA:
It’s the last bit of dragon magic
left in the whole world.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
I see why Heart guards it so
closely. Thank you, dep la. You’ve
been very helpful.
In a different world, maybe we
coulda been friends. But I have to
do what’s right for Fang.

BENJA:
Chief Virana, I’m so glad Fang
accepted our invitation.

YOUNG RAYA:
There is no way you’re taking
Sisu’s Gem.

YOUNG NAMAARI:
Sorry. It’s Fang’s now. 

BENJA:
You will not set foot on the Dragon
Gem’s inner circle.

FEMALE SPINE WARRIOR:
What’s going on?

SPINE CHIEF:
What is this?

FEMALE SPINE WARRIOR:
Fang’s making a play for the Gem!

SPINE CHIEF:
No! Spine should have the gem!

TAIL CHIEF:
Not if we get to it first! 

BENJA:
Listen to me!
We have a choice. We can tear each
other apart, or we can come
together and build a better world.
It’s not too late. I still believe
we can be Kumandra again... 

YOUNG RAYA:
Ba!

BENJA:
Druun...

YOUNG RAYA:
No!
Ba! Come on! We have to go!

BENJA:
(realizing)
They’re repelled by water.
(to everyone)
Hurry! Get to the river!

YOUNG RAYA:
Ba! Get up! Come on. Please, we
have to keep moving. Get up.
Please, ba! We don’t have time.
Look. Stand up! I’ll help you.

BENJA:
Raya, you have to listen. You are
the Guardian of the Dragon Gem.

YOUNG RAYA:
Ba, why are you saying this?

BENJA:
There’s still light in this.
There’s still hope. 

YOUNG RAYA:
No, we can make it together. You’re
okay...

BENJA:
(hands her the gem)
Raya, don’t give up on them.
I love you, my dewdrop.

YOUNG RAYA:
Ba?
NO!
...Ba!

RAYA:
(sigh)
Please let this be it.
Whoa, what are you doing you big,
fur bug? Hey buddy - focus. Eyes
forward, Tuk-Tuk.
Good boy! You’re so easily
distracted.
(flipping him back over)
You’re getting a little too big for
this, bud.
(to Tuk-Tuk)
Six years of searching and we end
up at a literal shipwreck. That’s
not a bad sign, is it?

TUK-TUK:
Hrmph.

RAYA:
Sisudatu... I don’t know if you’re
listening. I’ve searched every
river to find you. And now I’m here
at the very last one. Look, there’s
not a lot of us left and we
really... we really need your help.
If I can be honest, I really need
your help. I made a mistake. I
trusted someone I shouldn’t have.
And now the world’s broken.
(a beat)
Sisudatu, I just really... really
want my ba back. Please.
(deep breath)
Okay. Here goes everything.
(chants with reverence)
Suva de dra sim
Mandra de dra lim
Bavaa de dra Tomben.
(to Tuk Tuk)
I know, buddy, I haven’t forgot -

SISU:
(inside a dust cloud)
Where am I? Pengu? Amba? Pranee?
Are ya here?

RAYA:
(bowing)
Oh Mighty Sisu -

SISU:
Who said that?
Hello? Hello?

RAYA:
(muffled)
Mmf-mph!! 

SISU:
Ooo, I’m sorry, I didn’t see ya
there.
(picks Raya up)
Not too bad. Just a little dusty.
Let me get that for you.

RAYA:
(eyes widen)
Sisu. You are... Sisu!

SISU:
And you’re... people. What’s your
name?

RAYA:
Raya. I’m Raya.

SISU:
And you’re NOT made of stone, which
means...
It worked!

RAYA:
It worked!

SISU:
We did it! Ya hear that, Pengu? It
worked! I didn’t mess it up!
(notices Raya’s bag)
Is that food?
(drops Raya)
I was so focused on saving the
world, I forgot to have breakfast
today.

RAYA:
Today? When exactly do you think
“today” is?

SISU:
Tuesday.
(takes bite of food)
Ugh! I mean... Mmm. What is this
delightful culinary treat?

RAYA:
It’s jackfruit jerky. I dried it
myself.

SISU:
Well, compliments to the chef.
(offers jerky to Tuk-Tuk)
Wanna finish this, skippy?

RAYA:
Uh, Sisu, there are a few things I
need to catch you up on...

SISU:
Oh yeah?
You broke it!?! 

SISU:
Oh, oh, oh my. Oh, this is bad.
This is bad. I’ve been asleep for
500 years, you brought back the
druun, and none of my brothers and
sisters came back? Why didn’t they
come back?

RAYA:
I... don’t know.

SISU:
Also you broke the gem...

RAYA:
I still have a big chunk of it
though. 

SISU:
Is that supposed to make me feel
better? If you lost a puppy and I
said “Well we still have a big
chunk of it,” would that make you
feel better?

RAYA:
Can’t you just make another one?

SISU:
No, I can’t just make another one.

RAYA:
But you’re a dragon.

SISU:
I’m gonna be real with you,
alright? I’m not like the best
dragon. You know?

RAYA:
But you saved the world.

SISU:
I did do that. That’s true. But...
have you ever done like a group
project, but there’s like that one
kid who didn’t pitch in as much but
still ended up with the same grade?
Yeah... I wasn’t the one who
actually made the gem, I just...
turned it in.

RAYA:
Whoa, you’re glowing.

SISU:
Oh, thank you, I use aloe and river
slime to maintain my--

RAYA:
No, no-- look.

SISU:
This was my little sister Amba’s
magic. I got the glow!

RAYA:
Your little sister’s magic?

SISU:
Yeah, every dragon has an unique
magic.

RAYA:
Okay, what’s yours?

SISU:
I’m a really strong swimmer!

RAYA:
(processing)
Wait wait, you touched this gem
piece and it gave you powers. You
know what this means, right?

SISU:
I no longer need a nightlight?

RAYA:
What? No, you’re still connected to
the gem’s magic. And that means you
can still use it to save the world.
If we get all the other gem pieces,
You can reassemble it and -

SISU:
I can reassemble it and -

RAYA:
(leading)
Boom the druun away!

SISU:
(catches on)
Boom the druun away!

RAYA:
And bring my ba back?

SISU:
And bring ALL of Kumandra back. 

WAHN:
Princess Namaari, the Tail-lands
are infested with Druun. Benja’s
daughter is as good as stone out
here. Retrieving some useless
dragon scroll isn’t worth the risk.

NAMAARI:
Anyone else want to question why
we’re out here?

RAYA:
Okay, so here’s the sitch -

RAYA:
After the gem broke, each piece was
taken by one of the chiefs of the
five lands. Fang - 
Heart -
Spine - 
Talon -
- and Tail...
... where we are now.

SISU:
Wow, so many questions. First one -
Why am I wearing this?

RAYA:
Well, we don’t want to attract
attention.

SISU:
(looks at the hat)
Oh, you definitely chose the right
hat for that.
(walks forward)
So what makes you think the Tail
Chief’s here?

RAYA:
Because this place didn’t just
boobytrap itself.

SISU:
This doesn’t make sense. None of
this would stop a druun.

RAYA:
It’s not to stop druun. It’s to
stop people.

SISU:
Hm...
What? Why are you looking at me
like that?

RAYA:
Uh... nothing. Just not used to
seeing dragons.

SISU:
Impressed, huh? Wait till you see
my backstroke. I’m wicked when I
hit that liquid. I got water-skills
that kill. I slaughter when I hit
the water. I’m like... really good
at swimming. Through rhyme. I was
trying to make... that I was a
really good swimmer... I’m a good
swimmer... Is basically what I’m
saying...

RAYA:
Okay, we need to keep going.

SISU:
(loudly, scaring Raya)
Oh no! 

RAYA:
(concerned)
What? What is it?

SISU:
We forgot to bring a gift for the
Tail Chief.

RAYA:
I’m sorry, a gift?

SISU:
Yeah. A gift says “you can trust
me, can I trust you?” 
Aw, hey there little fella!
Oh, this beetle’s got a booty!

RAYA:
Careful! It’s a Toot N Boom!

SISU:
Why is it called a--
Got it. Noted. Makes sense.
You have to admit though, these bug
booties are kinda cute.

RAYA:
I’d say we found the Tail Chief.

SISU:
What happened to her?

RAYA:
From the looks of it, she was
hoarding the gem and became a
victim of her own traps.

SISU:
Well, you got to admire her
commitment.

RAYA:
Okay, hold on. 

SISU:
Oh, we were doing a jumpy thing. So
sorry. My bad. I get it now. I’m
with it.

RAYA:
Sisu? Don’t.
Phew.
(hands Sisu the gem)
Two down, three to go.

SISU-HUMAN:
I just shape-changed! Into people!

RAYA:
Dragons can do that?

SISU-HUMAN:
This was my sister Pranee’s thing! 
(plays around)
Look at my people arms and my
people face! Look at how close my
butt is to my head. Now that you
don’t have to hide me, getting the
rest of the gems is gonna be a
breeze!

RAYA:
Yeah well this one was easy, but
the rest of them are being held by
a bunch of no-good binturis.

NAMAARI:
Binturi? That’s not a very nice way
to describe an old friend.

RAYA:
Namaari.

NAMAARI:
What’s dripping, dep la? Oh, I see
you finally made a new friend. And
here I was worried you were gonna
end up becoming a cat lady. Like
me.

SISU-HUMAN:
Something tells me you’re not
besties?

NAMAARI:
Stealing dragon gem pieces, are we?
Why?

RAYA:
What can I say? Bling is my thing.

NAMAARI:
I gotta admit, Raya - until a few
months ago I thought you were
stone, but then someone stole
Fang’s dragon scroll -

RAYA:
Oh, is that why you’re chasing me?
And here I thought it was because
you missed me.

NAMAARI:
(picks it up)
Are you really looking for Sisu?
What are you? Twelve?

RAYA:
I actually was looking for Sisu.
Ooh, and guess what? I found her.
Say hi, Sisu!

SISU-HUMAN:
HI! It’s very nice to meet you. And
I love your hair - and your
cats’... hair.

NAMAARI:
(unamused)
Take them.

RAYA:
Run!
Not like that. Two legs!

SISU-HUMAN:
Right!

RAYA:
Tuk Tuk, roll!

RAYA:
Jump!

SISU-HUMAN:
Who was that girl?

RAYA:
That’s Namaari. She’s the
backstabbing binturi that broke the
world

SISU-HUMAN:
Wow, those cats are really fast,
huh?

RAYA:
What do cats and Druun have in
common?

SISU-HUMAN:
(guessing)
Um... they have no... souls!

RAYA:
(correction)
AND they both hate water.

SISU-HUMAN:
Oh...

RAYA:
Hold on!

RAYA:
Hello?! Is anybody here?

BOUN:
Welcome to the world famous Shrimporium. My name is Boun, I’ll be
your server today. Would you like
to hear our daily specials?

SISU-HUMAN:
Yes please!

BOUN:
We got shrimp. We got congee. We
got a shrimp congee that won’t
quit.

RAYA:
The captain! Where is the captain?

BOUN:
Lemme go get him!
(he walks to the other
side of the table)
What’s up, my new customers, I’m
Captain Boun, the owner, chef, and
Chief Financial Officer of the
Shrimp-orium. How can I help you?

SISU-HUMAN:
Well, I’m Sisu and -

RAYA:
And we need to get to Talon. NOW.

BOUN:
I’m sorry, the Shrimp-orium is not
a water-taxi.
Toi! That’s alotta jade!

RAYA:
Half now, half when we arrive in
Talon. Deal? 

BOUN:
Clasp onto your congee, today’s
special is--
(smug)
To-go. 

RAYA:
Uh... Captain Boun? Does this thing
go any faster?

BOUN:
Whoa, you didn’t tell me Fang was
after you! This is gonna cost you
extra!

SISU-HUMAN:
Don’t worry, I got it!

BOUN:
What is she doing?
What is happening?

RAYA:
My friend’s a really strong
swimmer?
Bye bye, binturi!

FANG OFFICER:
Princess Namaari. If they’re after
gem pieces, their next stop would
be Talon.

NAMAARI:
We’re not following them to Talon.
We’re going back to Fang. I need to
speak with Chief Virana.

RAYA:
Sisu? Sisu??

SISU:
Ah...

RAYA:
Please! Get out of there!

SISU:
(continues to swim)
I’m a water dragon. This is water.
It’s sorta my thing. You wanna come
in?

RAYA:
(whispers)
Someone could see you.

SISU:
Oh. Do you mean “Captain Pop and
Lock” over there? What, are you
scared he’s gonna challenge me to a
dance battle?

RAYA:
Sisu, I saw people lose their minds
over a dragon gem. Can you imagine
what they’d do over an actual
dragon? Look, we need you to make
this all work.
Until we have all the gems, you
have to stay human. Please.

SISU:
Wow. You’ve really got some trust
issues.

RAYA:
(sidebar response)
Look, my father blindly trusted
people and now he’s stone.

SISU-HUMAN:
Hey. We’ll get your ba back. I got
you, girl. Come on. Who’s your
dragon? I mean human. Because I’m
gonna be human until - yeah, you
get it.

BOUN:
Okay, who’s hungry?

SISU-HUMAN:
Ooo, I am!

BOUN:
Two house specials!
(spins a bottle of hot
sauce in his hand)
How spicy would you like it? Hot,
hotter, or Boun-goes-the-dynamite?

SISU-HUMAN:
Bring on the heat!

RAYA:
Yeah, no, no... I don’t think so.

SISU-HUMAN:
What are you doing?

RAYA:
(whispers)
We don’t know him. It could be
poisoned.

SISU-HUMAN:
(loudly)
Why would he poison us?

BOUN:
(offended)
Yeah, why would I poison you??

RAYA:
First, to get my jade purse.
Second, to steal my sword. And
third - I don’t know - to kidnap my
Tuk-Tuk.

BOUN:
All good points, but if this is
poison...
(slurps congee)
You’re gonna die happy.

RAYA:
Yeah, thanks but, we’ve got our own
eats.

SISU-HUMAN:
This is delicious!
(points at the food)
By the way. Not. Poison.
(heat hits her)
But... It’s hot - IT’S REALLY HOT!
Water! Boun? Captain Boun? We need
water on deck!

RAYA:
I know buddy.

BOUN:
You know, during the day, you can
almost forget they’re here, but at
night...
(clearly unnerved)
This is why I never leave the boat.

RAYA:
You’re a smart kid.

BOUN:
What are druun anyways?

SISU-HUMAN:
A plague born from human discord,
they’ve always been here - waiting
for a moment of weakness to attack.
They’re like the opposite of
dragons, instead of bringing water
and life to the world, they’re like
a relentless fire that consumes
everything in its wake until
there’s nothing left except ash and
stone.

BOUN:
They took my family.

SISU-HUMAN:
They took mine too.

BOUN:
Looks like we’re here! So where are
you guys headed after Talon? I
might be headed there too.
I mean, for a fee, of course.

RAYA:
Of course.

SISU-HUMAN:
Wow. What a smart way to druunproof your house - build right on
the water. People of Talon are
geniuses.

RAYA:
Yeah, Talon may look nice... but
it’s a hotspot for pickpockets and
con-artists.

SISU-HUMAN:
Lucky for me, empty pockets!

RAYA:
Okay, so here’s the good news. I
know where the gem piece is. The
bad news...

RAYA:
- it’s being held by the notorious
Chief of Talon, Dang Hai.
What Dang Hai lacks in style, he
makes up in mean.

SISU-HUMAN:
Gotcha. Now we’re just gonna have
to turn up the charm. Let’s go get
him a gift!

RAYA:
Sisu, I think maybe it’s safer for
you to stay here on the boat.

SISU-HUMAN:
What?

RAYA
Without you we can’t put the gem
back together.

SISU-HUMAN:
But I want to help.

RAYA:
I know, and you will. By staying
safe. 
I’ll be back before you know it.

BOUN:
If you see any hungry faces, send
’em my way.

RAYA:
You got it, Captain.
Alright, there’s Dang Hai’s house.
No detours until we score that
dragon gem.
Whoa. What in the -
(struggles with decision)
Uh...okay...
Hey... baby, toddler, thing,
whatever you’re called. It’s really
late, what are you doing out here?
Where are your parents? 
(calls out)
Hey. Whose baby -
What? Ongis! Drop em!
Really? A con-baby! 

SISU-HUMAN:
(shakes head)
This is giving me bad feels. Chief
Dang Hai does not sound like
someone you can smooth talk. Raya
didn’t even bring a gift.
(makes a decision)
That’s it. I’m going shopping!
Oh wait... I don’t have any money.

BOUN:
You’re an adult. You could just put
it on credit.

SISU-HUMAN:
Ooo, what’s credit?

BOUN:
It’s kinda like a promise. You take
what you want now and you promise
you’ll pay it back later.

SISU-HUMAN:
Pay it back later... What an
amazing concept! Thanks, Captain
Boun!

SISU-HUMAN:
I’ll be buying this with credit.
Ooo, Dang Hai’s gonna love this.
Credit, please. Oh, I like that.
Uh, yeah. I’ll be using credit.
Yes. I love credit!

MALE MERCHANT 1:
(points at her)
HEY! YOU!

MALE MERCHANT 2:
Are you going to pay for any of
that?

SISU-HUMAN:
Oh right, right. No, this is on
credit. Yeah, I’m gonna pay you
back later.

MALE MERCHANT 2:
Pay us back later? We don’t know
you!

FEMALE MERCHANT:
You have no credit here! Pay us
right now!

SISU-HUMAN:
Now? I don’t have anything, but...
if I could find my girl Raya, she
has a sword. Dried eats. Two Dragon
Gem pieces.
(realizes)
No we don’t. Whaaat? Who said that?

MALE MERCHANT 2:
You better pay up, binturi!

FEMALE MERCHANT:
This isn’t a charity!

MALE MERCHANT 2:
Who do you think you’re stealing
from?

DANG HU:
(slapping the Vendors’
hands away)
Nee, nee! Get away from her! Can’t
you see she’s new in town?
Come, dear. Don’t be afraid. It’s
okay.

RAYA:
(dodges)
Ah! Diaper!
(to Baby)
Thanks. 
So, it’s none of my business, but
using your baby charm to rip people
off is super sketchy.
(beat)
Alright, where’s your family?
(realizes)
Oh. Right.
Hey. How would you like to earn
some honest loot?
(cool and threatening)
Alright, Dang Hai, I’ll take that
dragon gem piece. 

CHAI THE FLOWER GUY:
Whoa! I’m not Dang Hai! I’m Chai,
the flower guy.

RAYA:
Where is Dang Hai?

CHAI THE FLOWER GUY:
He’s right over there.
The Big Bodyguard points to a decorated statue... it’s a
stoned Dang Hai.

RAYA:
What? Who has his gem piece?

CHAI THE FLOWER GUY:
The most vicious Chief Talon has
ever seen.

SISU-HUMAN:
Those folks were like crazy mad. I
just wanted to bring some gifts to
the Talon Chief, Dang Hai.

DANG HU:
Is that who you’re looking for
dear? I know exactly where he is.

SISU-HUMAN:
You do?

DANG HU:
Mm-hmm. I’ll take you there.

SISU-HUMAN:
SEE! That’s what I’ve been trying
to tell my girl Raya. But she’s all
like - “You can’t trust people.
Don’t talk to anyone. I only eat
terrible foods I dried myself.”

DANG HU:
Come, dear. Chief Dang Hai is just
outside the city, beyond the gates.
... they continue on through some gates.

SISU-HUMAN:
Away from the water, huh? Wow. He
really likes living on the edge.

SISU-HUMAN:
Hi there, Dang Hai. I’m Sisu and
I’ve come here to offer you some - 

DANG HU:
Now, you’re going to tell me where
I can find those other dragon gem
pieces. Or...
I’ll have to leave you outside with
that... thing. Take your pick.

SISU-HUMAN:
But I trusted you.

DANG HU:
Big mistake.
You better talk fast. It looks
hungry.

SISU-HUMAN:
No, no, no.
RAYA!

DANG HU:
Stop her!

RAYA:
Sisu, I told you to stay on the
boat!

SISU-HUMAN:
Sorry!

RAYA:
Hold onto this for me, will ya?
(celebrating)
Fog?! 

SISU-HUMAN:
Yeah, that was my brother Jagan’s
magic.

RAYA:
Okay, three down, two to go!
(yells out)
Alright, Captain Boun. Next stop -
(ducks a bowl thrown at
her)
Spine!

BOUN:
Thanks for the new customers!

RAYA:
Yeah, I sorta promised to buy them
all the congee they could eat.

BOUN:
Well, we’re stuck with them for
awhile. Cause Ongis have nine
stomachs.

RAYA:
Oh, toi.

SISU-HUMAN:
I can’t believe it. That old lady
was really going to hurt me.

RAYA:
Well, I’m sorry, Sisu, that’s what
the world is now. You can’t trust
anyone. 

SISU-HUMAN:
Does that include babies?

RAYA:
Uh, well...

SISU-HUMAN:
She’s so cute. I mean looks at
those cheeks!
(muffled)
Hi, I’m Sisu.
Aw, she loves my face.

RAYA:
(bemused)
Watch out she doesn’t steal your
teeth. Here, lemme help you.

SISU-HUMAN:
Oh, that’s so sweet... okay, too
much sweetness, too much sweetness!
It’s too much!

GENERAL ATITĀYA:
Chief Virana, we’re running out of
room. We need to expand to the
mainland.

VIRANA:
And how do you propose we handle
the druun, General Atitāya? Without
proper protection, it would be a
death sentence for our people.

NAMAARI:
I might have a solution for that,
mother.

VIRANA:
(genuinely happy)
My little morning mist, it’s good
to see you home.

NAMAARI:
I located Raya. She’s out stealing
gem pieces.

VIRANA:
What?

NAMAARI:
I’d like to take the royal army and
intercept her in Spine.

VIRANA:
Well, if she’s going into Spine, I
doubt there will be much left of
her to intercept.

NAMAARI:
She’s more capable than you
realize. We have to stop her.

VIRANA:
Walk with me.
Look around.
(points to Fang)
We made all this by making smart
decisions, not emotional ones. We
are safe. Our canal protects us
from those monsters. I don’t think
it’s wise to risk yourself when you
don’t have to.

NAMAARI:
But you heard the General - we’re
running out of space, we need to
expand. If we had all the gem
pieces, we could do that safely.
You’re right.
This isn’t an emotional decision,
it’s the only decision we can make
to secure Fang’s future.

VIRANA:
Namaari, you’re truly growing into
the leader I raised you to be.
(to the General)
General Atitāya, ready the royal
army for my daughter’s command.

NAMAARI:
Thank you, Mother. I won’t let you
down.

BOUN:
(to Ongis)
Hey! Stop eating!

RAYA:
Sorry, Buddy. I got this.

BOUN:
Did you just throw a shrimp at me?
That’s not even edible! Don’t look
at me like that, you fuzzy garbage
can.

RAYA:
(big smile)
Hey, guys. Do you want to play hide
and seek? 
Alright, ready? One, two...

BOUN:
(whispers)
Thanks.

RAYA:
Two and a half... Three...
(to Sisu)
Remind me to never have kids.

SISU-HUMAN:
Being people is hard.

RAYA:
(to Sisu)
Yep.
(over her shoulder)
Six...Seven...

SISU-HUMAN:
You have small heads, no tails, you
lie to get what you want. Like the
Talon Chief back there.

RAYA:
Yeah well, the world’s broken, you
can’t trust anyone.

SISU-HUMAN:
Or maybe the world’s broken BECAUSE
you don’t trust anyone.

RAYA:
(wistful)
You sound just like my ba.

SISU-HUMAN:
Well, he sounds like a smart man.

RAYA:
Yeah. He was. I really wanted to
believe him. I really wanted to
believe that we could be Kumandra
again.

SISU-HUMAN:
And we can.

RAYA:
Literally thousands of people
turned to stone would argue
otherwise.

SISU-HUMAN:
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t
try.

RAYA:
And I did. And you know what
happened? I got kicked in the back
by someone who gave me a “gift” -
Look around. We’re a world of
orphans because people couldn’t
stop fighting over a gem. Wanna
know why other dragons didn’t come
back? Because people don’t deserve
them.

SISU-HUMAN:
But you can change that.

RAYA:
I am done trying. Kumandra is a
fairy tale. The only thing
important to me now is bringing my
ba back.

BOUN:
Um... I think we’re in Spine.

RAYA:
Sisu!!!

BOUN:
Hey! My congee!

RAYA:
(to Boun)
Don’t go anywhere. I’ll be right
back.

RAYA:
Sisu! Come back! Please. What are
you doing?

SISU-HUMAN:
I’m going to show you that you’re
wrong!

RAYA:
How? By getting squashed by a bunch
of Spine rage-heads?

SISU-HUMAN:
No. By proving to you that if you
want to get someone’s trust, you
have to give a little trust first.

RAYA:
Sisu, don’t!

SISU-HUMAN:
In hindsight, maybe I was a little
hasty. But... who’s hungry? No?
I’ll leave you alone.

RAYA:
(to herself)
Okay... Where are we?

SISU:
Interesting choice of digs.

TONG:
You two must be dung of brain to
think you could steal Spine’s
dragon gem.

RAYA:
Gem? Who said anything about gems?
We have no interest in gems.
Okay, yeah. I can see how that
makes me look like a liar.

SISU-HUMAN:
Actually, I think it was the lying
that made you look like a liar. 
I’m not sure what’s funny.

TONG:
Your fear is like a delectable
nectar feeding the tum tum of my
soul. It’s good. It tastes like...
mango.

SISU-HUMAN:
Ooo, I love mango.

TONG:
(gets in Sisu’s face)
OF COURSE YOU LOVE MANGO! Only a
tongue-less cretin wouldn’t.

SISU-HUMAN:
Oh toi.

TONG:
It’s been such a long time since
I’ve last peered into the eyes of a
trembling enemy. 
Where has the time gone? It’s been
so long... 

SISU-HUMAN:
(to Raya)
He seems lonely.

TONG:
NO! I’m not lonely. I’m a Spine
warrior, I was born and bred to do
only one thing - to invoke fear and
to crush the skulls of my enemies.

SISU-HUMAN:
That’s actually two things.

TONG:
RWAR!!!

SISU-HUMAN:
Ah!

TONG:
Hehe. Look at your face.

RAYA:
Hey. What do you plan on doing with
us?

TONG:
Oh, it’s going to be bad.
Horrifying. It’ll take me two weeks
to clean up.

RAYA:
You have no idea, do you?

TONG:
Yes I do! I’m formulating this
gruesome plan in my head of... It
makes me sick just thinking about
it. You just wait. Until then...
(looks at them dangling)
... why don’t you just hang around?
Good one, huh? Hehe. 
A little one?

SISU-HUMAN:
Alright!

RAYA:
Good work, Captain Boun.

BOUN:
Fang’s here.

RAYA:
What?

NAMAARI:
People of Spine -

NAMAARI:
We are hunting for Raya, a fugitive
from Heart. Send her out or we’re
coming in!

RAYA:
You’re the only one here?

TONG:
My people battled the druun with
much valor... but lost.

RAYA:
(thinks)
Okay, the Fang gang’s here for me,
not for you. So if I can distract
them, you guys can get out of here.

SISU-HUMAN:
You’re gonna fight an entire army?

RAYA:
No, I’m just gonna stall them.
Look, I know how to push Namaari’s
buttons. Once you guys are clear,
I’m out of there.
(to Tong)
What’s your name?

TONG:
The moniker given to me is Tong.

RAYA:
(to Tong)
Okay, Tong, look, you don’t know
me, I don’t know you. But I’m sure
that you know a back door or way
outta here and it’s really
important that my friends stay
safe. Okay? So, I am sincerely
asking you, will you help us?
Please.

RAYA:
Okay. Note to self don’t die.

NAMAARI:
(commands)
Burn them out.

RAYA:
Hey there, princess undercut, fancy
meeting you here.

NAMAARI:
You and those dragon gem pieces are
coming with me.

RAYA:
My sword here says we’re not.
Yeah, I knew you couldn’t handle
rolling solo. You’re nothing
without your band.

NAMAARI:
Stand down. This shouldn’t take
long.

RAYA:
Didja need that, dep la?

NAMAARI:
Nah.

RAYA:
Looks like somebody’s been taking
classes.

NAMAARI:
Why are you stealing gem pieces?

RAYA:
Oh, I’m just trying to get a
matching set.
(through gritted teeth)
You didn’t happen to bring Fang’s
gem, did you?
No? Never mind, I’ll just swing by
and grab it later.

NAMAARI:
Oh, I’m going to enjoy this...

RAYA:
(approaches the team)
Yep. She’s a dragon. Let’s go. Come
on!

RAYA:
Did you just hit me with a shrimp
tail??

BOUN:
(agitated)
When were you going to tell us she
was Sisu?

RAYA:
Technically, you always knew she
was Sisu. Seriously?

TONG:
Why are you here, divine water
dragon?

SISU:
(shaking water out of her
ears)
Isn’t that obvious, big guy? My
girl Raya and I are gonna fix the
world - bring everyone back.

BOUN:
You’re gonna bring everyone back? I
want to help.

RAYA:
I’m sorry, I can’t let you do that.
It’s too dangerous.

BOUN:
You’re not the only one who lost
family to the Druun.
(kneels)
Please let me help you.

TONG:
I too wish to join this fellowship
of druun butt-kickery.

SISU:
My big brother Pengu’s magic...

RAYA:
Alright, Captain Boun. To Fang!

BOUN:
You got it!

RAYA:
Alright, everyone. Here’s the plan. 
The last gem piece is in Fang -
(Noi and the Ongi hiss)
- the most heavily guarded of the
five lands.
Now, they’re protected by an
artificial canal that separates
them from the rest of the world.
The only way in or out is by water.
Luckily for us, we have a magic
water-dragon.
Now, the palace will be swarming
with Fang soldiers.
To sneak past them, we’ll need to--

BOUN:
I got this, guys.
I’ll take care of the first wave.
Tong will follow up with his GIANT
AXE OF BAD-AXERY!
And then come the Ongis and that
crazy con-baby...
... who will toss the gem to THE
MIGHTY SISUDATU... RAWWWRRR...and
then...Bye, bye, binturis 
(smiles big at Raya)
Super flow plan, am I right?

RAYA:
(unamused)
Uh, no. Yeah, that’s not flow.
That’s a clog.

SISU:
I agree. Here’s my plan!
We infiltrate Fang, confront
Namaari...
(presents something nice)
... and offer her something nice
and go...
Hey. Want to help us save the
world? Because all it takes is one
gem piece! 
YES!!! I’ve been waiting for
someone to ask me!
(hands the gem over)
Here ya go!
Best friends forever!

RAYA:
Yeah, I think I’d rather go with
Boun’s plan.

SISU:
What?

BOUN:
YES!

SISU:
Why?

RAYA:
(duh)
Because it’s Fang.

TONG:
Their blades are specially designed
for the stabbing of backs.

BOUN:
If it weren’t for them, none of
this would have happened. They’re
the worst.

SISU:
If we’re just honest with her, deep
down, I got a feeling she wants to
fix the world as much as we do. 

RAYA:
You weren’t there when Namaari
betrayed me. We’re sticking with my
plan. Whoa! Uh, what’s with the downpour?

SISU:
Come on. I need to show you
something.

BOUN:
So... what do we do now?

RAYA:
Where are you taking me?
Sisu, why did you bring me here? 

SISU:
This is where it all happened.

RAYA:
(remembering)
Yeah, I know. I was there.

SISU:
No, this is where it all happened
500 years ago.
I want you to meet my brothers and
sisters. The real mighty ones. I
miss them.

RAYA:
I never knew they were here.

SISU:
(points)
See that classy looking one over
there? That’s Amba - I get my glow
from her. And that’s Pranee - she’s
the shapeshifter. Jagan - fog. And
Pengu... he’s our big brother. He
brings the rain.
(beat)
We were the last dragons.
All the other dragons had been
turned to stone. We were drowning
in a sea of Druun. 
But my oldest brother, Pengu,
refused to accept defeat. This is
where we’d make our last stand,
united.
So, one by one, they combined all
their magic, creating the dragon
gem. I don’t know why they chose me. It
could have been any of us. All I
know is I trusted them and they
trusted me. And so...
When they put their faith in me, it
empowered me beyond anything I
could imagine. The same can happen
with Namaari. 

RAYA:
I really wish I could believe that.
I once thought that we could be
friends.

SISU:
After all this, maybe you can be.

RAYA:
Even if she wanted to help us, how
could I possibly trust her?

SISU:
But if somehow you could, you
wouldn’t just bring your ba back -
you’d also bring back his dream.
Kumandra.

RAYA:
(touches his hands)
Do you think he would even
recognize me? So much has changed.

SISU:
Of course he will.

RAYA:
You remind me of him.

SISU:
Oh yeah? Strong, good-looking, with
impeccable hair.

RAYA:
Hopeful. 
How would I even approach Namaari
after all that’s happened?

SISU:
It may feel impossible. But
sometimes you just have to take the
first step even before you’re
ready. Trust me.

RAYA:
Okay. We’ll go with your plan.

SISU:
(surprised)
What? My plan? You’re gonna go with
my plan?

RAYA:
Yeah.

SISU:
ALRIGHT! You’re not gonna regret
this. But we’re gonna need a really
good gift. What do you think she’s
into? Cats? Knives? Cats with
knives? Knives with little cats on
them?

RAYA:
Actually, I know exactly what to
give her.

VIRANA:
... and that is how the land of
Fang rose in spite of all the
monsters that wanted to destroy us.
Because we’re smart, resilient, and
we take care of one another.

NAMAARI:
Mother, we need to talk.

KID:
It’s Princess Namaari!

VIRANA:
(laughs)
Alright, alright. Now run along,
kittens. I have to speak with the
princess.

NAMAARI:
Mother, you won’t believe what I
saw -

VIRANA:
You saw a dragon.
General Atitāya informed me that
you’d be returning home without the
gem pieces.

NAMAARI:
It was Sisu. She can fix what we
broke. She can bring everyone back.

VIRANA:
And that’s what scares me. When
everyone comes back, who do you
think they’ll come for? You forget,
the other lands blame us for what’s
happened.

NAMAARI:
But we never meant for anyone to
get hurt.

VIRANA:
Yes, but if we had the dragon and
the gem pieces, we would be
forgiven. We could save the world.
But more importantly, our people
would remain safe.

NAMAARI:
Raya isn’t just going to give Sisu
to us.

VIRANA:
We’re not going to give her a
choice.

NAMAARI:
What are you going to do?

VIRANA:
That’s no longer your concern, my
love. You’ve done enough.

TONG:
If she refuses to help, we’ve just
flushed our tactical advantage into
the dung pot.

RAYA:
I know.

BOUN:
Yeah. She really has no reason to
help us.

RAYA:
I know.

SISU:
(tries eating jerky)
This jerky is terrible.

RAYA:
I KNOW!

TONG:
Are you sure those four miniature
menaces will be successful?

RAYA:
I... don’t know.

NAMAARI:
Huh?

TONG:
There’s too much spice.

BOUN:
Uh, no, there’s too much bamboo.

TONG:
What do you know? You have the
tastebuds of a tall baby.

BOUN:
Well, you dress like a tall baby.

TONG:
Give me the spoon! I’m taking over!

BOUN:
Back off tidal wave, I’m the
professional here. 

RAYA:
(sprinkles in the sugar)
May I?

BOUN:
Whoa. That’s good!

RAYA:
It’s just a little something my ba
showed me.

SISU:
Aw. Did he also show you how to
make that delicious jerky?

RAYA:
No, that was all me. It’ll be nice
to share a meal with him again.

BOUN:
I know what you mean. I have this
really obnoxious sister who always
tussles my hair. I can’t wait to
see her the most.

TONG:
After we win the day, I look
forward to filling my eyeball with
the joy-tastic image of my village
full again. And you will be reunited with your
family, Noi.

RAYA:
Um, what did you just call her?

TONG:
Noi. It’s her name. It’s written on
her collar. Have none of you ever
checked? And they think of me as the
ruffian.

SISU:
What’s that mean?

RAYA:
It means we’re on.
(to Sisu)
Sisu, until we get that gem and
confirm Namaari’s actually on our
side, promise me you’ll stay
hidden.

RAYA:
(referring to the pendent)
I see you got my gift.

NAMAARI:
(staring at the pendent)
I never thought I’d see this again.

RAYA:
Well, I tried to take good care of
it. You’re not the only dragon nerd
here.

SISU:
(to Raya)
The final piece.

RAYA:
Time to bring everyone back.

NAMAARI:
Sisu and the gem pieces are coming
with me.

BOUN:
Sisu!

NAMAARI:
Stay back!

TONG:
It was foolish to trust someone
from Fang.

NAMAARI:
(to the gang)
Don’t come any closer!

RAYA:
Namaari, it doesn’t have to be like
this.

NAMAARI:
I don’t have any other choice.

SISU:
(to Raya)
Hey. I got this.
I know you don’t want to hurt
anybody.

NAMAARI:
What are you doing?

SISU:
You just want a better world. Like
we all do.

NAMAARI:
Sisu...

SISU:
I trust you, Namaari.

RAYA:
No!
SISU!!!!
No...

BOUN:
What’s happening?

TONG:
I don’t know. It appears that with
the last dragon gone so too goes
the water. Now there is nothing to
stop the druun. Nothing.

BOUN:
Raya...
(realizes Raya is gone)
Where’s Raya?

RAYA:
Namaari! 

NAMAARI:
(resolute)
Let’s finish this, binturi.

BOUN:
Raya!

TONG:
She cannot see us. Raya’s blinded
by her own rage.

BOUN:
(looks at his gem piece)
The gem’s powers are fading. All
these people are druun-food if we
don’t get them out.
Come on. Trust me, it’s gonna be
okay.
Stupid Druun! Outta my way! Go go
go!

TONG:
(to elderly lady)
Up we go.

BOUN:
Get to the water! Keep going! Keep
going!

NAMAARI:
I never meant for any of this to
happen.

RAYA:
Liar!

NAMAARI:
I don’t care if you believe me.
Sisu did. But you didn’t trust her.
That’s why we’re here.
Do whatever you want, but you’re as
much to blame for Sisu’s death as I
am.

BOUN:
Tong, there’s still people back
there! Hurry, we’re running out of
time.

TONG:
Got it! Everyone out! Come with me! 

RAYA:
(commands, to Tuk-Tuk)
Okay, Tuk. These are the last of
them. Go! We’re right behind you.
Tuk-Tuk!

NAMAARI:
(to Tuk Tuk)
What are you waiting for? Go!

BOUN:
Raya!

TONG:
(sees Namaari, rage-filled
eyes)
It’s the one who slayed Sisu!

BOUN:
(faint, far away)
Raya! Raya!
The gem’s magic is almost gone!

TONG:
They aren’t backing off!

BOUN:
They’re everywhere!

SISU:
I don’t know why they chose me. It
could have been any one of us. All
I know is I trusted them and they
trusted me. And so...

RAYA:
Everyone, give me your gems! We can
still put it together, it can still
work!

BOUN:
Sisu’s gone, Raya. We don’t have
her magic.

RAYA:
It’s not about her magic. It’s
about trust.

NAMAARI:
WHAT?

RAYA:
That’s why it worked. That’s why we
can do it too. By doing the one
thing Sisu wanted us to do — what
my Ba wanted us to do — to finally
trust each other and fix this. But
we have to come together. Please.

TONG:
After what she’s done -

BOUN:
We’ll never trust her!

RAYA:
Then let me take the first step.

BOUN:
Raya, no!
(in disbelief)
It worked! It worked! It --

RAYA:
Tuk-Tuk!

SISU:
(sees her siblings)
Pranee! Amba! Jagan! Pengu!
Raya!

RAYA:
Sisu.

SISU:
I. Am. So hungry.

RAYA:
I got some jerky.

SISU:
Not that hungry.

NOI:
Soo-soo!

TONG:
(Big inhale)
Ah! It is good to breathe in your
glorious dragon stench again.

SISU:
Okay, I take that as a compliment.

RAYA:
Ba.

BENJA:
Dewdrop?
Is that... really her?

SISU:
Chief Benja, your daughter did you
proud. Hope you don’t mind. She
brought some friends.

RAYA:
(to Benja)
Ba, welcome to... Kumandra.
