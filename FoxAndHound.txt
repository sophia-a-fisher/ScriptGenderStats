Big Mama: You poor little fella. It's all right. Big Mama's here. [She briefly looks out at the grasslands then turns back to the pup.] You know? You're gonna need some caring for. Now… now let's see darlin'. [The pup carefully approaches her. She paces around, thinking.] You need a… [She looks down. The pup has warmed up to her and is starting to cuddle her.] (amused) Oh no. No no no. Not me. Not Big Mama now. [She looks up, thinking.] Now I'm thinkin' though.

(The sounds of a woodpecker can be heard. Both Big Mama and the pup look toward the sound's direction.)

Big Mama: Oh. Ah ha! Now don't… don't you move, honey. Big Mama's gonna be right back. [She flies off.]

[The camera zooms in on a woodpecker and a sparrow in a tree]
[The woodpecker is drilling into the tree.]

Dinky: Good work, Boomer. We'll get him this time.

(They both stare into the hole.)

Dinky: Shh. I think he's in there.

(Big Mama flies on scene.)

Big Mama: Whew! Am I glad I found you boys. There's no time to lose. I need your help. Now come on. Come on!

(Big Mama flies off screen.)

Dinky: Let's go, Boomer. Come on.

Boomer: Yeah. But but but. . . Aw shucks.

(They both fly off. A caterpillar appears at the hole and breathes a sigh of relief.)

[The camera moves back to the fence]

(They all perch on the fence and look down at the pup.)

Boomer: Aw. Poor little guy.

[The camera takes a brief shot of the pup hiding in the grass]

Big Mama: Don't you worry now. We're gonna find someone to look after you.

Dinky: Hmm.

(Dinky hops around, thinking. He looks at the nearby farm house.)

Dinky: Hey! I think I got an idea.

(They huddle around and talk. The pup looks up at them curiously. Finally, they break.)

Dinky: Okay, Boomer. Now you know what to do.

Boomer: Yeah. Leave it to me. Leave it to me.

(Boomer flies up to the house. He perches on the doorknob and starts pecking at the door.)

Widow: Who is it?

(The door opens, smashing Boomer against a wall. An old woman appears.)

Widow: Well. I was sure I heard someone knocking.

(She gasps.)

Widow: Oh dear! My laundry!

[The camera moves to Big Mama and Dinky]

Widow: Oh! Here! Stop it! Oh you pesky birds! Will you come here?!

Widow: Oh! Stop!

Widow: Well! I wonder what got into those birds?

Widow: Well bless my soul! Why it's. . . it's a baby fox.

Widow: Oh. Hello little fella.

Widow: I wonder where its mother is?

Widow: Come on now. I'm not gonna harm you.

Widow: Now now. Oh isn't that. . .?!

Widow: Oh my my. You're a feisty little rascal. Aren't you?

Widow: There there. Now calm down. No, I just can't leave you out here all alone.

Widow: Isn't he darling?

Widow: Now not so fast. Now now. Not so fast.

Widow: Oh my. You're such a little toddler. Say! That's what I'll call you. . . Tod. You know, Tod? I'm not going to be so lonesome anymore.

[The camera moves in on an old dog sleeping in a barrel]

Amos: I've got a surprise for you, Chief old boy.

Amos: Now now now. Take it easy.

Amos: Well. How's this for a huntin' dog?

Amos: He's just a little runt now, but he'll grow.

Amos: You may as well get used to him, Chief. He's for you to look after from now on.

Widow: Tod. Stop pestering Abigail. Ha ha. (To Abigail) Abigail? You're going to have to be patient with Tod. He's one of the family now.

Widow: Ha ha! Oh of course. Now I know.

Widow: I declare I never will get my chores done.

Widow: Oh! Mercy! Tod! Stop it! Abigail! Abigail!

Widow: Oh! Oh no, there goes my milk! (She stands up in anger.) Oh no!

Widow: Easy. Easy, Abigail. (Holding the cow's head) Steady, old girl. Steady.

Widow: There there.

Widow: Tod! You come here! I said come here!

Widow: Just look what you've done!

Widow: Now. Don't try to butter me up. (She giggles.) Oh Tod. I just can't stay angry with you. You little imp. (She puts Tod down.) Now. Run along and play. Go on!

Widow: And try to stay out of mischief!

Tod: Hey! It's Dinky and Boomer. Maybe they wanna play.

[Camera change to a tree]

Dinky: Is this it, Boomer?

Boomer: Oh sure, Dinky! This is the place! I never forget a tree. I never forget a tree. Hoo hoo hoo.

Dinky: He won't get away this time. Heh heh!

Dinky: Hold it, Boomer! I think I hear somethin'.

Boomer: Oh that's him all right, Dinky. That's him all right.

Dinky: Shh shh. Get ready, Boomer. Hey! I can hear him movin'. Listen!

Boomer: Funny. I don't hear nothin'.

Dinky: Shh. Quiet!

Boomer: Oh that's him all right, Dinky. Oh that's him all right.

Dinky: Button your beak! Will ya?! (He flies back to the tree. He spots a hole.) I'll check it out. (He looks inside and sees the caterpillar munching on some leaves.) Will ya look at that? (He looks back at Boomer.) Okay, Boomer. He's right (points) there.

Dinky: Yikes! Watch it!

Squeeks: Aah!

Boomer: Why you. . .!

Dinky: Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!

Tod: Hiya fellas! Whatcha doin'? Wanna play?

Dinky: Stay out of this, kid. This don't concern you.

Dinky: Let him have it!

Dinky: Don't let the creep get away!

Dinky: You can take him, Boomer. Give him a left, a right. Let him have it!

Squeeks: Aah!

Boomer: Which way did he go?!

Dinky: This way!

Dinky: There he is!

Tod: What happened to ya? Golly!

Boomer: Oh shucks! I think I bent my b-b-beak!

Dinky: (irritated) Now see what you've done?! You've cost us our breakfast!

Boomer: I cost us our breakfast?! It was your fault!

Dinky: What're you talkin' my fault?!

Boomer: Oh yeah!

Tod: A worm? For breakfast? Yeck! Bleh.

[The camera pans over to Chief and Copper, who are drinking from their bowl]

Chief: Hey there, Copper. What ya sniffin' at?

Copper: Somethin' I never smelled before, Chief.

Chief: Hmm. Let me see. (He takes a long sniff in the air. He smiles.) Aw, shucks. That's easy. The master's just cookin' grits and fatback. You oughta know that.

Copper: Uh uh. That's not what I smell. I don't know, Chief. It's something else.

Chief: Heh heh! Sonny, you've got a lot of learnin' to do about a-sniffin' and a-smellin'. (He lies down inside his barrel. He sees Copper get up to leave.) Hey, where ya goin'?

Copper: I wanna find out what that smell is.

Chief: Okay, Copper, but the master ain't gonna like you wandering off.

Copper: I won't get lost, Chief. I can smell my way back. (walks away.)

Chief: Hmph. Can't tell these young whippersnappers anything.

[The camera moves back to Tod playing with the butterfly]

Tod: Whatcha smellin'?

Copper: I'm on the trail of somethin'.

Tod: Trail of what?

Copper: I don't know yet. (He continues sniffing until he reaches Tod. Copper sniffs at him.) Why it's you! (He let's out a howl.)

Tod: (he jumps to the ground.) What do you do that for?

Copper: We're supposed to do that when we find what we've been trackin'.

Tod: I'm a fox! My name's Tod. What's your name, kid?

Copper: Mine's Copper! I'm a hound dog!

Tod: Gee. I bet you'd be good playing hide and seek. Wanna try it, Copper?

Copper: Can I use my nose?

Tod: Ha ha! Sure! Okay. Now go ahead and close your eyes and count.

Copper: 1. . . 2. . . 3. . . (starts to look)

Tod: No, Copper! Ya can't peek!

Copper: Oh.

Tod: Now start again.

[The camera pulls back to include Big Mama, who's sitting in a tree]

Big Mama: My my. Look at that. A fox and a hound. . . playing together!

Big Mama: When you're the best of friends. . .

Big Mama: Having so much fun together. You're not even aware, you're such a funny pair. You're the best of friends.

Big Mama: Life's a happy game. You could clown around forever.

Big Mama: Neither one of you sees your natural boundaries.

Big Mama: Life's one happy game!

Amos: Copper!

Copper: Gee, I gotta go.

Big Mama: If only the world wouldn't get in the way.

Big Mama: If only the people would just let you play. They say you're both being fools.

Big Mama: You're breaking all the rules. They can't understand... the magic of your wonderland.

Big Mama: When you're the best of friends...

Tod: Copper!

Big Mama: Sharing all that you discover.

Big Mama: When these moments have passed, will that friendship last? Who can say if there's a way?

Big Mama: Oh I hope... I hope it never ends.

Tod: Come on, Copper!

Big Mama: ‘Cause you're the best of friends.

[The camera fades into a shot of them playing together]

Tod: Copper? You're my very best friend.

Copper: And you're mine too, Tod.

Tod: And we'll always be friends forever. Won't we?

Copper: Yeah. Forever.

Tod: (he pushes Copper off of him.) Hey! Let's go swimmin'!

Copper: Give me a head start, and I can beat ya!

[The camera changes to a shot of Amos trying to look for Copper]

Amos: Dag nabit! That Copper pup's gone and strayed off again. Come on, Chief. If that little rascal's gonna make me a good huntin' dog, he's gotta learn to mind.

[The camera moves back to the lake]

Amos: Copper! Get over here!

Amos: Copper!

Copper: Uh oh. I gotta go home. (crawls out of the lake)

Tod: Do ya have to? We're having too much fun.

Copper: (shakes himself dry) I gotta. He sounds awful mad.

Tod: I'll see ya tomorrow. And don't forget!

Copper: (runs home) I won't!

[The camera fades to a shot of Copper, who is tied up to his barrel]

Tod: Hey Copper. What happened to ya? Why didn't you. . .? (Seeing the rope) Golly! You're all tied up!

Copper: Yeah. And it's no fun, neither. The master says I gotta stay home.

Tod: Well. We can play around here, then.

Copper: Oh no! Not with old Chief over there.

Tod: Is that him making that awful noise?

Copper: He keeps me awake at night.

Copper: Oh don't go in there! He can get awful mean! He's cranky.

Tod: Gee willikers! Is he ever big!

Tod: His ears aren't as big as yours, Copper.

Copper: That's not the part you gotta worry about.

Tod: (pulls down Chief's lips) Wow! Look at those teeth!

Copper: That's the part you gotta worry about!

Copper: He's wakin' up! Get out, Tod!

Tod: No. He's having a dream. He's chasing somethin'.

Chief: It's a big old badger.

Tod: Copper. He's chasing a badger.

Chief: No. It ain't a badger. It's a. . . it's a. . .

Chief: It's a fox. A FOX!!!!!

Copper: Run, Tod! Run!

Widow: Tod!

Widow: Amos Slade, you trigger-happy lunatic! (Louder) Give me that gun!

Amos: My radiator! Why you blasted female!

Amos: I'll. . . I'll. . .

Widow: Hold it! Right there!

Amos: Watch it! That thing's loaded!

Widow: Now it ain't loaded!

Amos: (angrily) Dag nabit, woman! You're thieven' fox was after my chickens!

Widow: Rubbish and poppycock! I don't believe it! He wouldn't hurt a thing!

Amos: (furious) You callin' me a liar, you muddle-headed female?! I saw it happen!

Widow: Amos Slade, that temper of yours is gonna get you into a lot of trouble someday!

Amos: Temper! Temper! Woman, you ain't seen my temper!

Amos: If I ever catch that fox on my property again, I'll blast him! And next time I won't miss!

[The camera fades to a shot of a partially open window]

Widow: Poor little tyke. It's a shame I have to keep him cooped up.

Widow: Tod, stop looking at me like that. It's not my fault, you know. You caused a lot of trouble yesterday.

Widow: Oh, now what are they up to?!

Widow: Huh! Why it looks like Amos is goin' on a huntin' trip.

Widow: A long one from the looks of it. Hmph. Well good riddance.

[The camera moves over to Amos, who's trying to get his car started]

Amos: Dog gone meddlin' female! Shootin' up my radiator!

Amos: Dad blame it! (Kicks the car) Get goin'!

Amos: Well. That's more like it. Keep runnin' old girl.

Amos: Well, Copper. Me and old Chief are gonna teach you all about huntin'. Yes sir. And it's about time, too.

Copper: Woof!

Amos: That-a boy! Heh heh!

Amos: You're really gonna like trackin' down those varmints for me.

Chief: Uh uh! Get in the back, half pint. You gotta earn your right to sit up front.

Amos: Well boys. We're gettin' outta here ‘til next spring.

Big Mama: Tod. Honey? What are you doin' over here?

Tod: Gee. I just wanted to say goodbye to Copper. But I'm too late.

Big Mama: Well what did you plan to do if you ran into old Chief?

Tod: Aw Chief. I can outfox that dumb old dog any time.

Big Mama: Tod! Now hold it just one minute! Didn't you learn anything yesterday? Now you listen good, Tod. Because it's either education or elimination!

Big Mama: Now if you're so foxy and old Chief's so dumb, then why does the hound get the fox on the run? Because he's got the hunter, and the hunter's got the gun. Kablam! Elimination. Lack of Education.

Big Mama: If you pal around with that Copper hound, you'll wind up hangin' on the wall. Keep your nose to the wind, and you'll keep your skin. ‘Cause you won't be home when the hunter comes to call!

Tod: Oh Big Mama. I know Copper would never track me down. Why old Copper, he's my best friend!

Big Mama: Ho ho! You're best friend! Now Copper's gonna do what he's been told. Suppose to chase a little fox into an old foxhole. Then along comes a hunter with a buckshot load. . .

Boomer: Ka-ka-kablam!

Big Mama: Elimination!

Dinky: Lack of Education.

Big Mama: You'd better believe it, Tod. Yes sirree.

Tod: You mean Copper's gonna be my enemy?!

Dinky: Hey kid! You'd better step over here and take a good look.

Tod: W. . . why that's awful! Those poor things.

Big Mama: I'm sorry, Tod.

Big Mama: Honey. Copper's gonna come back a trained huntin' dog. A real killer.

Tod: Oh no. Not my friend Copper. He won't ever change.

Big Mama: I hope you're right, Tod.

Tod: And we'll keep on being friends forever. Won't we, Big Mama?

Big Mama: Darlin'. Forever is a long, long time. And time has a way of changin' things.

[The camera moves around the farm]

[The camera moves in on a patch of snow]

[The camera moves over to a makeshift scarecrow]

Dinky: Jiminy. It sure turned cold!

Boomer: I'm freezin' my b-b-b. . .

Dinky: Hey! It's that fuzzy worm!

Dinky: Let's get him. Charge!

Squeeks: Aah!

Boomer: Hey Dinky! Dinky quick! Over here!

Boomer: I got him! I got him!

Dinky: Do I look like worm? (Points) That's who we're after!

Dinky: Come on!

Dinky: Look at that little creep. Warm and cozy by the fire.

Boomer: Let me take a look!

Boomer: Now how do you like that g-g-guy?! Snug as a bug!

Boomer: While we're out here freezin' our b-b-beaks off!

Dinky: Brr. Well yakin' and shiverin' ain't gettin' us anywhere. We'll get that no good worm when we come back!

Boomer: Ooh sh-sh-shucks!

Dinky: So long, Big Mama.

Boomer: Yeah. We're goin' south for the winter.

Big Mama: Goodbye boys! See you next spring!

[The camera fades back to the cabin]

[The camera fades to a shot of Amos' car motoring down a road]

[The camera changes to a shot of Big Mama's tree]

Big Mama: Well look who's here.

Big Mama: Oh my goodness. Ha ha! I'm sorry, Tod honey. I hope. . .

Dinky: Hiya, Big Mama!

Dinky: We're back! We flew all the way!

Boomer: Oh yeah. We did. We did.

Big Mama: Welcome home, boys!

Big Mama: You know? It's been kinda lonesome around here without you little rascals.

Tod: Hi fellas!

Boomer: Hey! Who's that?! Who's that?!

Dinky: Hey! This can't be that scrawny little squirt we found by the fence post. Can it? Come on.

Boomer: I can't believe my eyes!

Tod: Ha ha! Aw. It's me all right.

Dinky: Hey lookie there. He's got himself a real fancy collar.

Boomer: Hey hey hey! Just look at this bushy tail. B-b-b-beautiful!

Tod: Ha ha! Aw come on. Cut it out. You guys are always teasing me.

[The camera moves to the widow's front door]

Dinky: Hey it's him! It's him! Squeeks!

Dinky: We'll see ya later, kid. We gotta take care of some unfinished business.

Widow: I can't understand. It was so healthy.

Widow: There. That ought to perk it up.

Boomer: Now where'd he go? Where'd he go?

Dinky: He's goin' up the drain pipe! I'll head him off!

Dinky: Okay, Boomer! We've got him trapped! Let him have it!

Dinky: Did you get him?

Boomer: Get him?

Dinky: No, I didn't.

Boomer: Neither did I.

Dinky: Come on! Look!

Boomer: Hoo hoo hoo! Caterpillar under glass. Oh boy!

Boomer: Holy!

Dinky: Smoke!

Boomer: Hey. Hey. How's he do that, Dinky? How's he do that?

[The camera fades to a shot of the road in front of the farm]

Amos: I ain't got no job. I'm a huntin' man. And I'd rather have a dog than a dollar. So let's go banjo ring-a-ling-a-ding ho! Give a little hoot and a holler! Ha ha!

Amos: Aw come on, Chief. Just 'cause you're not sittin' up front, that ain't no reason to be a sore head. Shucks. If it weren't for you, Copper'd never turned into a good huntin' dog. Yes sirree. Now I've got me the best two dogs there is. Right, Copper?

Amos: Ha ha! Isn't he somethin', Chief?

[The camera moves over to the fence]

Tod: Look, Big Mama! Copper's back! Heh. Boy, has he grown big.

Big Mama: Uh huh. And look at that big pile of skins he helped track down.

Tod: I know, Big Mama. He's a huntin' dog now.

Big Mama: You're right. And you're a fox.

Tod: Oh that won't make any difference. Copper's gonna be glad to see me.

Big Mama: Well, honey. Just don't get your hopes too high.

Tod: Look, don't worry. I'll be careful. I'll go over tonight when Chief and the hunter are sound asleep.

[Camera change to Copper and Chief's barrels]

Copper: Boy. It's great to be back home. Isn't it, Chief?

Chief: Hmph.

Copper: Aw come on, Chief. You aren't still sore. Are ya? (Pause) Hey! Hey come on! Let's scuffle! We ain't scuffled in a long time! Come on, Chief! Let's have some fun!

Chief: Oh lay off, Copper. You overgrown pup, you.

Chief: Oh let go! Dagnabbit! Let go I say!

Copper: Okay okay.

Chief: You know that was your trouble on the hunt.

Copper: Aw come on, old timer! You treat me like a pup. You know that? I think I've done real good trackin' down them varmints for you.

Chief: Smellin' and trackin' ain't enough. You gotta think nasty! Heh!

Copper: Okay okay. I know. Heh. I know.

Tod: Copper. Hey Copper. It's me. Tod.

Copper: I thought that was you, Tod. I-I heard you comin'. Boy, you've really grown.

Tod: You have, too, Copper. I saw you comin' back with Chief and the hunter.

Copper: It's great to see you, Tod. But you know you. . . you shouldn't be over here. You. . . you're gonna get us both into a lot of trouble.

Tod: Hey look I. . . I just wanted to see you. We. . . we're still friends. Aren't we?

Copper: Tod. Those days are over. I-I'm a huntin' dog now.

Copper: You'd better get out of here before old Chief wakes up.

Tod: Aw Chief. (Nervous laugh) He doesn't worry me.

Copper: Tod, I'm serious. You're fair game as far as he's concerned.

Amos: It's that fox again!

[The camera moves to the widow's house]

Widow: Oh no! No! They're after Tod!

[The camera shifts back to Amos, Chief, and Copper]

Amos: After him, boys! Go get him!

Amos: Copper! Copper! Copper!

Copper: Tod I. . . I don't want to see you get killed!

Amos: Track him down, boy!

Copper: I'll let you go this one time!

Amos: Don't lose him!

Amos: There they are! Old Chief's got him on the run!

Amos: Jump, Chief! Jump!

Copper: Chief! Chief?

Copper: Oh no! No!

Copper: Tod! If it's the last thing I do, I'll. . . I'll get you for this!

[The camera fades to a shot of Widow Tweed walking through the forest]

Widow: Tod! Tod?! Tod!

Widow: Oh Tod. Thank heaven you're safe.

[The camera fades to Amos' house]

[The camera moves to the front door]

[The camera focuses back on Copper as Amos passes]

Copper: Poor Chief. And it's all my fault. I shouldn't have let Tod go!

[The camera focuses on Big Mama's tree as Amos stomps past it]

Dinky: Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up! There's trouble!

[The camera changes to inside the widow's house]

Widow: Tod. What is it?

Widow: What on earth?

Amos: Widow! Get out here!

Widow: Why Amos! What are you. . .?!

Amos: Where is he?! Where is he?! I know he's in there!

Widow: Now just a minute! You can't come barging onto my property, Amos Slade!

Amos: That fox of yours almost killed Chief, and I'm gonna get him!

Amos: You can't keep him locked up forever!

[The camera fades to a close-up of a photograph]

[The camera pulls back to reveal the widow looking into the mirror]

[The camera changes to outside her house]

[The camera pans over to Amos Slade, who's looking disappointed]

[The camera moves back to the widow's car]

Widow: We met, it seems, such a short time ago. You looked at me, needing me so. Yet from your sadness, our happiness grew. And I found out I needed you too!

Widow: I remember how we used to play. Ha ha!

Widow: I recall those rainy days.

Widow: The fire's glow that kept us warm. And now I find we're both alone. Goodbye may seem forever. Farewell is like the end. But in my heart's the memory, and there you'll always be.

Badger: Hold it, sonny! Back off! Consarnit! Wh-where do you think you're goin'?

Tod: Oh. Oh excuse me! I-I-I was just trying to. . .

Badger: You barge in on somebody's house like you own it! Tarry hootin' around the woods! Wakin' up folks in the middle of the night!

Tod: I honestly didn't know anybody lived here. And I. . .

Badger: Well, you know it now! Now get of my property! Go on! Beat it!

Porcupine: I've been watching you, sir. You can stay with me if you want to.

Tod: That's very nice of you.

Porcupine: C-come with me.

[The camera fades to the widow's car driving up the road]

[The camera moves to Amos]

Amos: She dropped that fox off at the game preserve. We'll get him. We'll get him!

Chief: Well now. If you gotta have a busted leg, this is the way to do it. Good food. Soft pillow. Warm stove. Sure beats sleepin' in that barrel.

Chief: Well now. Here comes visitors to see the invalid.

Chief: How do you like that? They didn't even ask how I'm feelin'.

Amos: (snapped) Chief. Get back in there before I break your other leg.

Amos: Copper. Copper. Lookie here.

Amos: Now when that fox comes traipsin' along, suspectin' nothin'. . .

[The camera fades to a shot of Big Mama flying over the forest]

Big Mama: Tod! Tod?

Big Mama: Whew. Oh boy. These old wings ain't what they used to be.

Big Mama: Big Mama, you'd better lose a few pounds.

Big Mama: Uh oh! Uh oh! There he is! There he is!

[The camera moves to a shot of a fox whose back is toward it]

Big Mama: Tod! Tod!

Vixey: Oh hi, Big Mama!

Big Mama: Oh it's you, Vixey!

Vixey: Hey. What brings you way out here?

Big Mama: I'm lookin' for a fox named Tod. He's new here in the forest.

Vixey: Oh, new? Um. Well, what does he look like?

Big Mama: Oh, he's young. About your age.

Big Mama: And handsome.

Vixey: Handsome? Oh! Say. . . Gee, he sure sounds nice. Uh. Um. I'm not doing anything. I. . . I'll help you find him.

Big Mama: Ha ha! Come on. He's gotta be around here somewhere.

[The camera fades to a shot of a hole in a tree]

[The camera zooms inside]

Tod: Aah! What happened?! Where am I?!

Tod: Aah!

Badger: So! It's you again! You've barged in on me last night! And now you. . .

Tod: I. . . I didn't mean to!

Badger: Just look at the mess you made.

Badger: (angrily) DAD GRANIT!!!! YOU CLUMSY BONEHEAD!!!!!!

Tod: Sorry! It was an accident!

Badger: Excuses. Excuses.

Porcupine: Mr. Digger, sir. It was so too an accident.

Badger: You keep out of this, you walking pin cushion!

Porcupine: Uh. You shouldn't be so grumpy to someone who's new in the neighborhood!

Badger: A stranger, eh?

Badger: Why don't you go back where you came from?!

Tod: Wha. . .

Badger: Well go on! Get goin'! Get!!!

[The camera moves back to Tod]

Vixey: Aw. Gosh he seems so. . . I don't know. . . so downhearted, Big Mama.

Big Mama: Well. You can't blame him, honey. He was dropped out here and left all alone without a friend in the world.

Vixey: W. . . You know maybe there's something I can do. You know. Cheer him up.

Big Mama: Honey! You just said the magic words!

Vixey: Wha. . . Oh, but Big Mama. I don't know.

Big Mama: Darlin'! Don't move. You look beautiful!

Vixey: Thank you.

Big Mama: Mornin', Tod!

Tod: Oh. Hello, Big Mama.

Big Mama: Last night was pretty miserable for you. Wasn't it, honey?

Tod: Just terrible!

Big Mama: Cheer up! And look around.

Big Mama: The forest is beautiful this morning.

Tod: After last night, nothin' looks beautiful.

Tod: Wow! Who. . . who is. . . is that?

Big Mama: Oh. Just another fox.

Big Mama: A lady fox.

Tod: Golly! Is she beautiful! I wonder what her name is?

Big Mama: Well. Why don't you go ask her?

Tod: Yeah! Yeah I guess I will!

Tod: I'll. . . I'll go up to her, and I'll say. . . you're the most gorgeous. . . the most beautiful f-f-f. . . I've never seen anyone. . . anywhere. . . I'll say. . .

Big Mama: Shh! Now just keep it down.

[The camera moves back to Tod and Vixey]

Vixey: Oh! Tod, you know something?

Vixey: This stream is just full of trout. D-do you think you can catch one?

Tod: One what?

Vixey: One what? Fish! Silly.

Tod: Oh. Oh yeah! Oh yeah. (Confident) My dear young lady.

Tod: You happen to be looking at an expert fisher fox!

Big Mama: Oh Tod. Tod. Don't overdo it.

Tod: I know all the tricks. In fact I. . . I never miss.

Big Mama: Please! Let him catch a fish!

Tod: Uh oh! Here comes a whopper! Now. Watch closely.

Vixey: Tod. Do. . . do you need help?

Tod: No. No I-I-I do it this way all. . . all the. . . all the. . . time!

Tod: I got him!

Boomer: Oh that farm boy! He don't know nothin' about f-f-fishin'!

Dinky: He ain't gonna hook her that way!

Vixey: Oh gosh! Tod! You're the funniest thing I ever saw!

Tod: Go ahead. . . go ahead and laugh! You're like everyone else around here!

Vixey: I'm sorry. I can't help it! You were so funny!

Tod: So I can't fish!

Vixey: Hey just a minute! I mean you've got a nerve! Why don't you grow up?!

Big Mama: Tod! That's no way to talk to Vixey!

Tod: Aw raspberries! I've had it!

Big Mama: Honey. Don't stay mad. You gotta be natural. That's the trick. Can't you see?

Big Mama: When you have a natural attraction. . .

Big Mama: You deserve a mutual reaction.

Big Mama: You're gonna get a whole lot of satisfaction.

Big Mama: Here's all you gotta do.

Big Mama: When you feel that natural affection. . .

Big Mama: To lead you in the positive direction.

Big Mama: You gotta stop showin' off and start showin' up. . .

Big Mama: With little old natural you.

Big Mama: Yes you gotta appreciate the lady. And now that is a natural fact.

Big Mama: ‘Cause when you be yourself with the lady, yeah!

Vixey: 7! Ha ha! (Joyously) Oh.

Vixey: I think six would be just right.

Tod: Six?

Tod: Six what?

[The camera pans across the scenery and stops at a waterfall with a lake in front]

[The camera fades to a shot of a warning sign on a wire fence]

Amos: No hunting. Well now. We ain't gonna do none of that. Are we, Copper?

Amos: We're just gonna get us a no-good fox. Ha ha ha!

Amos: All right, boy. Get trackin'. Smell him out.

[The camera moves through various scenes of Copper sniffing around]

Amos: Whatcha got there, Copper?

Amos: Good work, boy. He'll be comin' right through here headin' for water. But he won't be drinkin' any.

[The camera fades to a shot of a large tree]

Tod: What a beautiful morning, Vixey!

Tod: You know I've never been happier.

Vixey: Oh Tod. Me too.

[The camera fades to a close-up of a set up trap]

[The camera then pans across a line of more set up traps until it reaches Amos setting the last one]

Amos: That does it. Amos, you crafty old coot. Ha ha! The devil himself couldn't have done no better!

[The camera changes to a shot of Vixey approaching the area]

Vixey: Tod. Tod, wait a minute.

Tod: What is it, Vixey?

Vixey: I don't wanna go in there. It's too quiet.

Tod: Aw Vixey.

[The camera moves over to Amos]

Amos: What?

[The camera moves back to Tod]

Vixey: Tod. Be careful.

Amos: Dad blast it! He's gettin' away!

Tod: Quick, Vixey!

[The camera follows them through several scenes of running before they stop]

Tod: Go on! Head for the burrow!

Tod: Quick, Vixey! Out the back!

Vixey: Tod!

Vixey: (terrified) Oh! Oh no, Tod!

Amos: Heh heh heh!

Amos: Copper! Copper!

Amos: We got ‘em now for sure! This is their only way out!

Amos: Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.

[The camera moves back inside the burrow]

Vixey: Tod!

Vixey: We're trapped!

Vixey: Tod, I'm scared!

Tod: Quick, Vixey! This is our only chance!

Amos: No! No, I don't believe it!

Amos: Copper, We've trapped him now.

Amos: Copper!

Vixey: Tod!

Copper: Tod?

Amos: Come on, Copper! Get out of the way!

Amos: Well. [He walks forward and pets Copper] Come on, boy. Let's go home.

[The camera fades to a shot of Big Mama's tree]

[The camera zooms in on the tree and then on Big Mama]

[The camera moves to a shot of Dinky and Boomer farther up the tree]

Dinky: Shh shh. This is it. We got him for sure, now.

Boomer: Oh my g-g-gosh!

(At the same time)

Dinky: Yow! Boomer: Wow!

Dinky: What happened?

Boomer: Hey.

Boomer: There's something very familiar about those eyes, Dinky.

[The camera gives a brief close-up of the butterfly's face]

Dinky: Nah. It couldn't be.

Dinky: Could it?

Big Mama: Bye, Squeeks. Bye. Good luck, honey.

Amos: Ouch! You're killin' me! Ouch!

[The camera moves over to Amos' house]

Widow: Amos Slade. Will you hold still? You're behaving like a child.

Amos: Well for gosh sakes! You're hurtin' my foot, woman!

Widow: Nonsense!

Widow: Your foot is mendin' fine. You'll soon be yourself. Oh! Land sakes. I don't know if I'll like that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[The camera pans back to include Copper and Chief sitting in their barrels]

Amos: Ow! Be careful! [he continues fussing about his leg being hurt by his iron steel trap that he stepped into by mistake during the battle with a bear.]

Chief: Huh! He's sure makin' a big fuss over a little old hurt leg.

[Copper yawns and lays down to go to sleep; he closes his eyes and smiles as he thinks about when he and Tod were best friends.]

Young Tod: Copper? You're my very best friend.

[The camera pans back as the memories continue]

Young Copper: And you're mine too, Tod.

Young Tod: And we'll always be friends forever. Won't we?

Young Copper: Yeah. Forever.

[The camera finally stops far away]
