FAMILY... AND MIRABEL(NA)*

ABUELA ALMA:
Abre los ojos... open your eyes....

YOUNG MIRABEL:
This is where our magic comes from?

ABUELA ALMA:
Mm-hmm, this candle holds the
miracle given to our family.

YOUNG MIRABEL:
How did we get a miracle?

ABUELA ALMA:
Long ago, when my three babies had
just been born, your Abuelo Pedro
and I were forced to flee our home.
And though many joined us, hoping
to find a new home... we could not
escape the dangers... and your
Abuelo was lost.
But in our darkest moment... we
were given... a miracle.
The candle became a magical flame
that could never go out and it
blessed us with a refuge in which
to live. A place of wonder...

YOUNG MIRABEL:
An Encanto...

ABUELA ALMA:
An Encanto.
The miracle grew... and our house,
our casita itself, came alive to
shelter us.
When my children came of age, the
miracle blessed each with a magic
gift to help us. And when their
children came of age...

YOUNG MIRABEL:
They got magic too.

ABUELA ALMA:
That’s right... and together our
family’s gifts have made our new
home... a paradise.
Tonight, this candle will give you
your gift, mi vida. Strengthen our
community, strengthen our home.
Make your family proud.

YOUNG MIRABEL:
(solemn, nodding)
Make my family proud.

ABUELA ALMA:
Yes, yes, Casita, we’re going.

YOUNG MIRABEL:
What do you think my gift will be?

ABUELA ALMA:
You are a wonder, Mirabel Madrigal.
Whatever gift awaits, will be just
as special as you.

MIRABEL:
Make your family proud.
Morning, Abuelo.

PUMPED JUANCHO:
Hey! When’s the magic gift happen?!

MIRABEL:

LITTLE ALEJANDRA:

KIDS:

MIRABEL:

myself... I’m only part of the

alone, are you? Casita, help me
out.

ABUELA ALMA:

ABUELA ALMA
What are you doing...?

MIRABEL:
(nothing to see here)
Uh, they were just asking about the
family and --

LITTLE ALEJANDRA:
She was about to tell us about her
super awesome gift!

DOLORES:
Oh, Mirabel didn’t get one.

INNOCENT CECILIA:
You didn’t get a gift?

DONKEY DELIVERY GUY:
Mirabel? Delivery! I gave you the
“special” since you’re the only
Madrigal kid with no gift. I call
it the “not special” special. Since
uh, since you have no gift.

MIRABEL:
Thanks.

DONKEY DELIVERY GUY:
Ooo and tell Antonio good luck.
Last gift ceremony was a bummer.
(LEAVES, RETURNS) Last one being
yours that did not work.

INNOCENT CECILIA:
If I was you, I’d be really sad.

MIRABEL:
Well, my little friend I am not,
because the truth is, gift or no
gift, I am just as special as the
rest of my family.

ISABELA:
Who wants more pink?

LUISA:
Alright guys, where do I drop the
wagon?

INNOCENT CECILIA:
Maybe your gift is being in denial.

PEPA:
I made a rainbow!

MIRABEL:
Oh sorry... excuse me...

ABUELA:
Lift it higher... higher.

CAMILO:
Hey nice job over there, yeah yeah.

ABUELA ALMA:
Camilo, we need another José.

CAMILO:
(changing shape)
Jooooosé!

ABUELA ALMA:
Luisa, the piano goes upstairs.

LUISA:
I’m on it.
(nearly runs over Mirabel)
Careful, sis!

PEPA:
My baby’s night has to be perfect
and it’s not perfect and people are
going to be coming and nothing’s
ready, the whole town will be here -

FÉLIX:
Pepi, Pepi, Pepita - you’re
tornadoing the flowers - the
flowers!

ISABELA:
Did someone say “flowers?”

FÉLIX:
Our angel, our angel.

ISABELA:
(cloying)
Please, don’t clap.

PEPA:
Thank you.

ISABELA:
Oh, it’s nothing.
Uch, a little sisterly advice if
you weren’t always trying too hard
you wouldn’t be in the way.

MIRABEL:
Actually, Isa, this is called
(LUGGING BASKET) helping, and I’m
not in the way, you ar--oof--

JULIETA:
Whoa. Mi vida, you okay? You don’t
have to over-do it.

MIRABEL:
I know, Mamá, I just want to do my
part like the rest of the family.

AGUSTÍN:
She’s right, Amor --

MIRABEL:
Eee--

AGUSTÍN:
First gift ceremony since yours,
lot of emotions - and I’ve been
there --

MIRABEL:
(to Julieta)
Bee stings.

JULIETA:
Ay, Agustín.

AGUSTÍN:
-- when me and your Tio Félix
married into the family - outsiders
who had no gift, never ever would,
surrounded by the exceptional, it
was easy to feel... “un-ceptional”--

MIRABEL:
-- okay, Papi --

AGUSTÍN:
-- I’m just saying I get it--

JULIETA:
(to Agustín)
Eat.
(to Mirabel)
Mi amor, if you ever want to talk --

MIRABEL:
I gotta put out the stuff, the
house isn’t gonna decorate itself -
(off the “offended house”)
Sorry, you could. You look great.

JULIETA:
(calling)
Corazon, remember you have
nothing to prove.

AGUSTÍN:
(horning in on the
advice)
Yeah, remember... nothing to
prove!

BACKGROUND WALLA:
You guys can set up over here. /
Clean your rooms, I don’t care how
big they are. / Anybody seen my
tiple?

ABUELA ALMA:
One hour!

MIRABEL:
No, no no --

ABUELA ALMA:
Maybe you should leave the
decorations to someone else?

MIRABEL:
No, I actually made these as a
surprise - for you-- (REALIZING
IT’S ON FIRE) ooo--

ABUELA ALMA:
Mirabel, I know you want to help.
But tonight must go perfectly. The
whole town relies on our family, on
our gifts. So the best way for...
some of us to help is... to step
aside, let the rest of the family
do what they do best. Okay?

MIRABEL:
Mm-hmm.

ABUELA ALMA:
(looks O.S., calls off)
Pepa, you have a cloud!

PEPA:
(overly emotional)
I know, Mamá, but now I can’t find
Antonio! What do you want from me?!

JULIETA:
Mamá, be nice to Mirabel okay. You
know tonight will be hard for her.

ABUELA ALMA:
If the gift ceremony doesn’t go
well this time, tonight will be
hard for us all...

FÉLIX:
Antonio?!

MIRABEL:
(seemingly to no one)
Everyone’s looking for you.
(nothing)
This present will self-destruct if
you don’t take it in three, two,
one...
Nervous?
(off his nod)
You have nothing to worry about.
You’re gonna get your gift and open
that door... and it’s gonna be the
coolest ever. I know it.

ANTONIO:
What if it doesn’t work?

MIRABEL:
Well... in that impossible
scenario... you’d stay in here in
the nursery... with me. Forever.
And I’d get you all to myself.

ANTONIO:
I wish you could have a door.

MIRABEL:
You know what? You don’t have to
worry about me, ‘cause I have an
amazing family... and an amazing
house, and an amazing you.
And seeing you get your special
gift and your door... that’s gonna
make me way more happy than
anything.
But alas, I am going to miss having
the world’s best roomie...
I know you’re an animal guy. And I
made this, so when you move into
your cool new room you always have
something to snuggle with.
(faux-serious)
Alright, hombrecito, you ready?
Sorry, I gotta get one more
squeeze.
Okay, okay, we’re going! Ow!

LUISA:
Here yah go.

CAMILO:
Oye, Osvaldo! / Hola Señora. /
Cecilia, up top!

FÉLIX:
There you are!

PEPA:
(tearing up)
Look at you, all grown up --

FÉLIX:
Pepi, you’re gonna get him all wet.

CAMILO:
You make-a your Papá proud.

FÉLIX:
I don’t sound like that.

CAMILO:
“I don’t sound like that.”

DOLORES:
Abuela says... it’s time.

PEPA:
We’ll be waiting at your door!

FÉLIX:
Okay, okay, vamo, vamo, vamo--

CAMILO:
“Okay, okay, Vamo, vamo, vam--” --
(yanked away by Félix)
- alright I’m done!

ABUELA ALBA:
Fifty years ago, in our darkest
moment, this candle blessed us with
a miracle.

ABUELA ALMA:
And the greatest honor of our
family has been to use our
blessings to serve this beloved
community. Tonight, we come
together once more as another steps
into the light... to make us proud.

MIRABEL:
I can’t...

ANTONIO:
I need you.

MIRABEL:
Come on. Let’s get you to your
door.

ABUELA ALMA:
Will you use your gift to honor our
miracle? Will you serve this
community and strengthen our home?

ANTONIO:
(happily surprised)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I understand you.
(off the toucan’s squawked
response)
Of course they can come!

ABUELA ALMA:
WE HAVE A NEW GIFT!!

LITTLE ALEJANDRA:
It’s bigger on the inside?!

FÉLIX:
WEPA ANTONIO! Vaya, vaya.

ANTONIO:
You wanna go where?!
Wooooaaah!
Woooo-hoooo!

ABUELA ALMA:
I knew you could do it... a gift
just as special as you.
We need a picture! Everyone, come
come, come, come, come! It’s a
great night, it’s a perfect night.
Everyone together

FAMILY / EVERYONE:
LA FAMILIA MADRIGAL!

MIRABEL:
(singing)
DON’T BE UPSET, OR MAD AT ALL...
DON’T FEEL REGRET, OR SAD AT ALL...
HEY, I’M STILL A PART OF THE FAMILY
MADRIGAL...
AND I’M FINE, I AM TOTALLY FINE
I WILL STAND ON THE SIDE AS YOU
SHINE...
I’M NOT FINE, I’M NOT FINE...
(singing)
I CAN’T MOVE THE MOUNTAINS
I CAN’T MAKE THE FLOWERS BLOOM
I CAN’T TAKE ANOTHER NIGHT
UP IN MY ROOM
WAITING ON A MIRACLE
I CAN’T HEAL WHAT’S BROKEN
CAN’T CONTROL THE MORNING RAIN OR A
HURRICANE
CAN’T KEEP DOWN THE UNSPOKEN
INVISIBLE PAIN
ALWAYS WAITING ON A MIRACLE, A
MIRACLE...
ALWAYS WALKING ALONE
ALWAYS WANTING FOR MORE
LIKE I’M STILL AT THAT DOOR
LONGING TO SHINE LIKE ALL OF YOU
SHINE
ALL I NEED IS A CHANGE
ALL I NEED IS A CHANCE
ALL I KNOW IS I CAN’T STAY ON THE
SIDE
OPEN YOUR EYES
OPEN YOUR EYES
OPEN YOUR EYES...
I WOULD MOVE THE MOUNTAINS
MAKE NEW TREES AND FLOWERS GROW
SOMEONE PLEASE JUST LET ME KNOW
WHERE DO I GO?
I AM WAITING ON A MIRACLE
A MIRACLE
I WOULD HEAL WHAT’S BROKEN
SHOW THIS FAMILY SOMETHING NEW
WHO I AM INSIDE
SO WHAT CAN I DO?
I’M SICK OF WAITING ON A MIRACLE
HERE I GO...
I AM READY!
C’MON, I’M READY!
I’VE BEEN PATIENT AND STEADFAST AND
STEADY!
BLESS ME NOW AS YOU BLESSED US
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO
WHEN YOU GAVE US A MIRACLE
Am I too late for a miracle...?
Ow --
Casita...?

FÉLIX:
Come on, Abuela! Tirame un paso --
Wepa!

MIRABEL:
THE HOUSE IS IN DANGER! THE HOUSE
IS IN DANGER!
(out of breath)
The tiles were falling and there
were cracks everywhere and... the
candle almost went out.

ABUELA ALMA:
Show me.

MIRABEL:
What? No, that’s --- the cracks
were there, they were...
everywhere. The house was in
trouble, the, the candle was...
Abuela, I promise -

ABUELA ALMA:
That’s enough.
There is nothing wrong with La Casa
Madrigal. The magic is strong...
and so are the drinks! Please --
music! A bailar, a bailar!

MIRABEL:
If it was all in my head, how did I
cut my hand? I would never ruin
Antonio’s night. Is that really
what you think?

JULIETA:
What I think is that today was very
hard for you

MIRABEL:
That’s (not)-
(then)
I was looking out for the family.
And I might not be super-strong
like Luisa, or effortlessly perfect
like “Señorita Perfecta” Isabela,
who’s never even had a bad hair
day. But... (SIGHS) Whatever...

JULIETA:
I wish you could see yourself the
way I do. You are perfect, just
like this. You’re just as special
as anyone else in this family.

MIRABEL:
Mm-hm. You just healed my hand with
an arepa con queso.

JULIETA:
I healed your hand...
(playful)
...with my love for my daughter,
with her wonderful brain--

MIRABEL:
Agh.

JULIETA:
--big heart--

MIRABEL:
Stop.

JULIETA:
--cool glasses--

MIRABEL:
Mamá.

JULIETA:
Ay, te amo, cosa linda.

MIRABEL:
I know what I saw.

JULIETA:
Mira, my brother Bruno lost his way
in this family... I don’t want the
same for you. Get some sleep.
You’ll feel better tomorrow.

ABUELA ALMA:
Ay, Pedro... I need you. Cracks in
our casita... If our family knew
how vulnerable we truly are... if
our miracle is dying. We cannot
lose our home again.
Why is this happening?
(then)
Open my eyes. If the answer is
here, help me find it. Help me
protect our family. Help me save...
our miracle.

MIRABEL:
I will save the miracle.
(to the House)
Wait. How do I save a miracle?
(lightbulb)
I figure out what’s happening to
the miracle. (OFF THE HOUSE) Oh, I
have no idea, but there is one
person in this family who hears
everything about everything...
....so if anyone would know what’s
wrong with the magic, it’s her.
(like it’s not weird)
Dolores, hey. You know, out of all
my older cousins, you’re like my
favorite cousin, so I feel like I
can talk to you about anything,
ergo you can talk to me about
anything, like the problem with the
magic last night that no one seemed
to worry about, but maybe you heard
about that maybe I should know
about.

FÉLIX:
Camilo! Stop pretending you’re
Dolores so you can have seconds.

CAMILO:
Worth a shot. Ah! Ey!

DOLORES:
The only one worried about the
magic is you... and the rats
talking in the walls...(BIZARRE, A
BEAT) oh, and Luisa. I heard her
eye twitching all night.

LUISA:
There we go.

ABUELA ALMA:
(agitated)
Everyone to the table. Let’s go,
let’s go --

MIRABEL:
Luisa--

ABUELA ALMA:
Family, we are all thankful for
Antonio’s wonderful new... gift...

ANTONIO:
I told ‘em to warm up your seat.

ABUELA ALMA:
Thank you, Toñito. I’m sure today
we’ll find a way to put your
blessings to good use....
(trailing off, O.S.)
...as must we all, we are the
caretakers of this Encanto...

MIRABEL:
Luisa, Dolores says you’re totally
freaking out, any chance you maybe
know something about last night,
with the magic -
(off Luisa)
You do!

ABUELA ALMA:
Mirabel
If you can’t pay attention I will
help you.

MIRABEL:
Actually, I--

ABUELA ALMA:
Casita?
As I was saying, we must never take
our miracle for granted, so today,
we will work twice as hard.

MIRABEL:
(trying to go to Luisa)
Mhmm, I will help Luisa --

ABUELA ALMA:
Stop. First, an announcement. I’ve
spoken to the Guzmans about
Mariano’s proposal to Isabela.
Dolores, do we have a date?

DOLORES:
(listens “to town”)
Tonight. (LISTENS) He wants five
babies.

ABUELA ALMA:
Wonderful, such a fine young man
with our perfect Isabela (PLUCKS
OUT WRONG FLOWERS) will bring a new
generation of magical blessings and
make both of our families stronger.

CAMILO:
(as Mariano)
Mmmm. (Makes kissy sounds) Ay!

ABUELA ALMA:
Okay, our community is counting on
us, La familia Madrigal!

MIRABEL/ FAMILY:
-- La Familia Madrigal!

MIRABEL:
Luisa hey --

ISABELA:
(calling after)
What is your problem?!

MIRABEL:
(calling back)
Ugh, sorry - (O.S. impact) - Hey
Luisa! Hold up!

SRA. OSMA:
Luisa, can you re-route the river?

LUISA:
Will do!

SR. RENDON:
Luisa, the donkeys got out again.

LUISA:
On it.

MIRABEL:
(calling after)
Luisa, wait a second --
You gotta tell me about the magic.
What’s going on? What are you
hiding?

LUISA:
Nothing, just gotta lotta chores,
so maybe you should just go home.

SR. FLORES:
Luisa, my house is leaning to the--
oh!

MIRABEL:
Dolores said your eye was twitching
and it never twitches, something’s
making you nervous --

LUISA:
Hey move, you’re gonna make me drop
a donkey.

MIRABEL:
Luisa?! Will you just-- Just tell
me what it is!

LUISA:
There’s nothing to tell --

MIRABEL:
You’re obviously worried about
something! Luisa, if you know
what’s hurting the magic and it
gets worse ‘cause you won’t tell me
what’s wrong --!

LUISA:
NOTHING’S WRONG!
Wow, uh, sorry, that, uh, that
snuck out there... what I meant
was... “why would anything be
wrong?” I’m totally fine. The
magic’s fine. Luisa’s fine. I’m
totally not nervous.

MIRABEL:
Your eye is... doing the thing...

LUISA:
(singing)
I’M THE STRONG ONE, I’M NOT
NERVOUS,
I’M AS TOUGH AS THE CRUST OF THE
EARTH IS

MIRABEL:
Okay...

LUISA:
I MOVE MOUNTAINS, I MOVE CHURCHES,
AND I GLOW, CUZ I KNOW WHAT MY
WORTH IS

MIRABEL:
Course I mean -- (TO DONKEYS) hey,
where are you going?

LUISA:
I DON’T ASK HOW, HARD THE WORK IS,
GOT A ROUGH, INDESTRUCTIBLE
SURFACE.
(gaining momentum!)
DIAMONDS & PLATINUM, I FIND ‘EM, I
FLATTEN ‘EM, I TAKE WHAT I’M
HANDED, I BREAK WHAT’S DEMANDED,
BUT...
UNDER THE SURFACE
I FEEL BERSERK AS A TIGHTROPE
WALKER IN A THREE RING CIRCUS
UNDER THE SURFACE
WAS HERCULES EVER LIKE “YO, I DON’T
WANNA FIGHT CERBERUS?”
UNDER THE SURFACE
I’M PRETTY SURE I’M
WORTHLESS
IF I CAN’T BE OF SERVICE
A FLAW OR A CRACK
THE STRAW IN THE STACK
THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL’S BACK
WHAT BREAKS THE CAMEL’S BACK?
IT’S...
PRESSURE LIKE A DRIP DRIP DRIP
THAT’LL NEVER STOP, WHOA...
PRESSURE THAT’LL TIP TIP TIP TIL
YOU JUST GO POP, WHOA...
GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER, YOUR
SISTER’S OLDER
GIVE HER ALL THE HEAVY THINGS WE
CAN’T SHOULDER

NO CRACKS, NO BREAKS!
NO MISTAKES!
NO PRESSURE!

MIRABEL:
I think you’re carrying way too
(GETS SQUEEZED) much.

LUISA:
Maybe I over do it.

MIRABEL:
(getting squeezed)
Yup.

LUISA:
Um, there is something you should
know last night, when you saw the
cracks, I felt... weak.

MIRABEL:
Wha- What, what, what?!

SR. RENDON:
Luisa, the donkeys!

LUISA:
On it!

MIRABEL:
Wait, wait, wait - what do you
mean? What do you think’s hurting
the magic?

LUISA:
Don’t know. But I heard the grown
ups once before Tio Bruno left, he
had like some terrible vision about
it.

MIRABEL:
Tio Bruno? What was in his vision?

LUISA:
No one knows, they never found it.
But if something’s wrong with the
magic, start with Bruno’s tower,
find that vision.

MIRABEL:
(calling after)
Wait, how do you “find” a vision?!
What am I even looking for?

LUISA:
If you find it, you’ll know. But be
careful... that place is off limits
for a reason.

ABUELA ALMA:
Such a perfect match.

ISABELA:
So perfect.

ABUELA ALMA:
And so good for the Encanto.

MIRABEL:
Casita, can you turn off the sand?
You can’t help in here?
I’ll be fine. I need to do this,
for you, for Abuela... maybe a
little for me.
(looks to sand)
Find the vision, save the mir-ack!
Whoa...
Oh, hello. (THEN) Lotta stairs, but
at least I’ll have a friend-- (the
toucan flies away) no, you flew
away immediately.
Alright.
(talk-singing)
Welcome to the Family Madrigal...
(NEXT POP)...there’s so many stairs
in the Casa Madrigal... (NEXT POP)
you would think there’d be another
way to get so high cause we’re
magic, but no -- magical, how many
stairs fit in here! Bruno, your
room is the worst!!
Come on...
Okay, I can do this. (looking at
the gap) Ooo...
Wooooo!
Quitter.
Empty....
(whispered, to herself)
What’s hurting the magic?
Me...?

ABUELA ALMA:
Uch, where are you coming from in
such a hurry?

MIRABEL:
I’m sorry. I was --

ABUELA ALMA:
(seeing bits of sand)
What’s in your hair?

MIRABEL:
(flustered)
Uh --

LUISA:
My gift! I’m losing my gift!

ABUELA ALMA:
What?!

LUISA:
Mirabel and I were having this
little talk about me carrying too
much, so I tried not to carry so
much but I realized it was putting
me behind and I knew I was gonna
let everyone down and felt really
bad so I was grabbing all the
donkeys but then when I went to
throw the donkeys in the barn, they
were... heavy.

ABUELA ALMA:
What did you do? What did you say
to her?

MIRABEL:
Nothing. I - I don’t--

ABUELA ALMA:
Mirabel --
Ach, I have to go get the Guzmans
for Isabela’s engagement.
(torn, off Mirabel)
Stay away from Luisa until I can
talk to her. Tonight we can’t have
any more problems. And whatever
you’re doing, stop doing it!

MIRABEL:
(to herself)
Why am I in your vision, Bruno?
(hiding the shards)
Tía, jeez --

PEPA:
(trying to shoo clouds)
Sorry, sorry, I- I didn’t mean to --
shoo, shoo, shoo, -- I just wanted
to get the last of Toñito’s things -
and then I heard “the name we do
not speak.”
(a rumble of thunder,
comedically dramatic)
Great, now I’m thundering. And a
thunder will lead to a drizzle and
a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle--
(to herself, a mantra)
Clear skies, clear skies, clear
skies--

MIRABEL:
Uh, Tía Pepa - if Bru- if he had a
vision about “someone” what would
it mean for them?

PEPA:
We don’t talk about Bruno.

MIRABEL:
I know, it’s just, hypothetically,
if he “saw” you --

PEPA:
-- Mirabel, please. We need to get
ready for the Guzmans.

MIRABEL:
I just want to know if it was
generally positive... or... like
less positive or--

FÉLIX:
It was a nightmare!

PEPA:
Félix!

FÉLIX:
Ey, she needs to know, Pepi. She
needs to know.

PEPA:
We don’t talk about Bruno.

FÉLIX:
He would see something terrible,
and then crack-ba-boom, it would
happen.

PEPA:
We don’t talk about Bruno.

MIRABEL:
What if you didn’t understand what
he saw?

FÉLIX:
Then you better figure it out,
because it was coming for you!

PEPA:
WE DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO, NO NO NO
WE DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO...
BUT! IT WAS MY WEDDING DAY

FÉLIX:
IT WAS OUR WEDDING DAY

PEPA:
WE WERE GETTING READY AND THERE
WASN’T A CLOUD IN THE SKY

FÉLIX:

PEPA:

GRIN—

FÉLIX:

PEPA:
YOU TELLING THIS STORY OR AM I?

FÉLIX:
I’M SORRY MI VIDA GO ON...

PEPA:
BRUNO SAYS, “IT LOOKS LIKE RAIN.”

FÉLIX:
WHY DID HE TELL US?

PEPA:
IN DOING SO, HE FLOODS MY BRAIN

FÉLIX:
ABUELA, GET THE UMBRELLAS...

PEPA:
MARRIED IN A HURRICANE

FÉLIX:

PEPA/FÉLIX:

DOLORES:

OYE, MARIANO’S ON HIS WAY

DOLORES:
HE TOLD ME THAT THE MAN OF MY
DREAMS WOULD BE JUST OUT OF
REACH... BETROTHED TO ANOTHER--

ISABELA:

HEY, SIS, TONIGHT I WANT NOT A
SOUND OUT OF YOU.

DOLORES:

MIRABEL:

BRUNO... GIMME THE TRUTH AND THE
WHOLE TRUTH BRUNO!

FAMILY:
HE’S HERE!

ALL:
DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO!

MIRABEL:
WHY DID I TALK ABOUT BRUNO?!

ALL:
NOT A WORD ABOUT BRUNO!

MIRABEL:
I NEVER SHOULDA BROUGHT UP BRUNO!

AGUSTÍN:
Miraboo. Got your party pants on,
‘cause I do--

MIRABEL:
(spilling out)
I... broke into Bruno’s tower, I
found his last vision, the family’s
in trouble, the magic is dying, the
house is breaking, Luisa’s gift is
fading and I think it’s all because
of... me? Pa?

AGUSTÍN:
(smiling but panicking)
We say nothing, Abuela wants
tonight to be perfect, ‘til the
Guzmans leave, you did not break
into Bruno’s tower, the magic is
not dying, the house is not
breaking, Luisa’s gift is not
fading, no one will know, just act
normal, no one has to know.

DOLORES:
(whispered)
I know.

MIRABEL:
She’s gonna tell everyone.

ABUELA ALMA:
(sweetly, but firm)
Time to eat!

AGUSTÍN:
Miércoles.

ABUELA ALMA:
The Guzmans and the Madrigals
together will be so good for the
Encanto.

ABUELA GUZMAN:
Yes, then let’s hope tonight is not
a horrible disaster.

ABUELA ALMA:
(chuckles, then toasts)
To a perfect night. Salud!

EVERYONE:
Salud!

ABUELA GUZMAN:
I assumed that all was well in La
Casa Madrigal...though, when it
comes to my Mariano, it is always
best to see for myself.

MARIANO:
Avocado?

ABUELA GUZMAN:
La Familia Madrigal has always been
a pillar of our communi...ty...

FÉLIX:
(not in front of company)
Camilo, fix your face.

ISABELA:
Water?

ABUELA ALMA:
(a little weirded-out)
Mirabel, the cream, please.

MIRABEL:
Pa, the cream.

ABUELA ALMA:
(clearly embarrassed)
Pepa? The cloud.

PEPA:
Clear skies, clear skies, clear
skies..

MARIANO:
Mirabel...?
...everything okay?

AGUSTIN:
Everything’s great, she’s just...
excited! For you to propose, which
you should do as fast as you can --

MIRABEL:
Yes!

MARIANO:
Uh, I was actually... gonna...

MIRABEL:
You were actually gonna! Great!

ABUELA GUZMAN:
Well, well -- well...since
everyone here has a talent, my
Mariano wanted to begin with a
song. Luisa, could you bring over
the piano?

LUISA:
(through tears)
Okay.

MIRABEL:
Uh, it’s actually family tradition
to sing after.

MARIANO:
(Takes a breath)
Isabela, most graceful of all the
Madrigals Um...

MIRABEL:
You’re doing great.

MARIANO:
The most perfect flower in this
entire Encanto.

MIRABEL:
No --

MARIANO:
...in this entire Encanto.
WILL YOU... MARRY ME?!

MIRABEL:
Nooo!

ABUELA GUZMAN:
What is happening?!

DOLORES:
(blurting)
Mirabel found Bruno’s vision, she’s
in it, she’s gonna destroy the
magic and now we’re all doomed!

TOWNSFOLK:
FELICIDADES - (SEES CHAOS) whoa...

ABUELA ALMA:
Señora, por favor!

MIRABEL:
Abuela, please -- there’s gotta be
an explanation!

ISABELA:
(to Mirabel, dramatic)
I hate you!

LUISA:
(crying)
Ahh, I’m a loser!

AGUSTIN:
Luisa!

PEPA:
(to Mirabel)
What did you do?!

MIRABEL:
I’m not doing anything! It’s
Bruno’s vision! It’s...

ABUELA ALMA:
The magic is strong! EVERYTHING IS
FINE! We are the Madrigals!
(shuts door)
MIRABEL!

MIRABEL:
HEY!

CAMILO:
(sooo calming)
It’s okay, Mami, deep breath in,
deep breath out...

MIRABEL:
Stop! STOP!
No-no-- HELP! HELP!
(desperate, to the House)
CASITA?! CASITA?!
(but it can’t help)
HELP ME! HELP ME!

TIO BRUNO:
You’re very sweaty.

MIRABEL:
Oh no!

TIO BRUNO:
Huh. Bye.

MIRABEL:
(confused, pursuing)
What? No -- Hold on --
Wait, wait -- Ow -- why did you
take the vision? -- what does it
mean -- Is it why you came back or--

TIO BRUNO:
Knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood.

MIRABEL:
Tio Bruno?

TIO BRUNO:
(tapping a wall, OCD)
Knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood.
You were never supposed to see that
vision, no one was -- a little
salt.

MIRABEL:
But -- (SPUTTERS ON SALT)

TIO BRUNO:
Sugar. (HE TOSSES SUGAR ON HER)
Sana sana, colita de rana.

MIRABEL:
Wait, have you been in here...
patching the cracks?

TIO BRUNO:
Oh that? No, no, no, no, no, I’m
too scared to go near those things.
All the patching’s done by
Hernando.

MIRABEL:
Who is... Hernan--

TIO BRUNO:
(different voice)
--I’m Hernando and I’m scared of
nothing.
(takes off hood, regular
voice)
It’s actually me. I used to say my
real gift was acting.
(yet another voice)
I’m Jorge, I make the spackle.

MIRABEL:
(beat)
How long have you been... back
here? (realizing)
You never left.

TIO BRUNO:
Well, I- I left my tower, which was
you know, a lotta stairs, and uh in
here - (SHOWS FOOD) eh? Kitchen
adjacent - ooo plus, free
entertainment!
So whattya like? Whattya like? You
like sports? Game Show?
Telenovelas?
(re “romantic” rat)
Their love could never be.

MIRABEL:
(looking around)
I don’t understand.

TIO BRUNO:
Well, because she’s his aunt and
she has amnesia, so she can’t
remember that she’s his aunt, you
see it’s like a very forbidden kind
of

MIRABEL:
I don’t understand why you “left,”
but didn’t “leave?

TIO BRUNO:
(avoiding eye-contact)
Oh, well... because you know the
mountains around the Encanto are
pretty tall... and uh - you know
like I said, free food... and
everything...
(to the rats)
Yeah, you guys, you guys love the
free food, don’t ya? Always hungry,
never satisfied...
My gift wasn’t helping the
family... but uh... but I love my
family, you know... I just don’t
know how to... I just don’t know
how to...
Well anyway, I think you should go,
because um -- well, I don’t really
have a good reason, but if I did,
you’d be like, I should go ‘cause
that’s a good reason.

MIRABEL:
Why was I in your vision? Tio
Bruno...?
(off his look, the most
honest she’s been)
I just... wanted to make the family
proud of me... just once. But if I
should stop... if I’m hurting my
family... just tell me.

TIO BRUNO:
I can’t tell you... (SHE SIGHS,
FRUSTRATED) Because I don’t know.
 had this vision the night that
you didn’t get your gift.
(Mirabel turns, surprised)
Abuela worried about the magic, so
she begged me to look into the
future, see what it meant...
And I saw the magic in danger...
our house... breaking... and
then... and then, and then... I saw
you. But the vision was different.
It... it would change... and there
was no one answer... no clear fate.
Like your future was undecided. But
I knew how it was gonna look, I
knew what everyone would think
because I’m Bruno and everyone
always assumes the worst... so...
so...

MIRABEL:
You left... to protect me...?

TIO BRUNO:
I don’t know which way it’ll go...
but my guess... the family, the
Encanto, the fate of the miracle
itself - it’s all gonna come down
to you.(SHRUGS) Or maybe I’m wrong.
(CHUCKLES) You know, it’s a
mystery, it’s a mystery that’s why
this vision is (FART SOUND).
(then, walks her to door)
Look if I could help anymore I
would but, that’s all I know. Good
luck. I wish I could’ve seen more.

MIRABEL:
(nods, solemn)
Yeah....
(then lightbulb)
Yeah!
You “wish you could’ve seen more.”
So see more. (SHAKING BRUNO) Have
another vision!

TIO BRUNO:
Oh, uh, no, no, see, I don’t, I
don’t do visions anymore.

MIRABEL:
But ya could.

TIO BRUNO:
But I won’t.

MIRABEL:
You can’t say “the weight of the
world is on your shoulders, the
end.” If our fate’s up to me, me
says have another vision, maybe
it’ll show me what to do --

TIO BRUNO:
Look, even if I wanted to, which I
don’t, you wrecked my vision cave,
which is a problem ‘cause I need a
big open space --

MIRABEL:
We’ll find one.

TIO BRUNO:
Where?

ANTONIO:
Use my room.
The rats told me everything.
(then, looking O.S.)
Don’t eat those.

MIRABEL:
Our family needs help.
(then)
And you need to get outta here.

TIO BRUNO:
(I see your point)
Mmyeh.

ABUELA ALMA:
(to Agustín)
You should have told me the second
you saw the vision! Think of the
family.

AGUSTÍN:
I was thinking of my daughter!

ABUELA ALMA:
Pepa, calm down!

PEPA:
I’m doing my best!

FÉLIX:
Yes.

PEPA:
You’re lucky it’s not a hurricane!

JULIETA:
Mamá, you’ve always been too hard
on Mirabel.

ABUELA ALMA:
Look around. We must protect our
family, our Encanto. We cannot lose
our home!

OLD ARTURO:
Señora, perdón, people in town are
becoming anxious about the magic.
They want to see you.

ABUELA ALMA:
Mirabel was in that vision for a
reason. Find her.

MIRABEL:
We might wanna hurry.

TIO BRUNO:
Ya can’t hurry the future, uh...
And what if I show you something
worse? If I see something that you
don’t like, you’re gonna be all,
“Bruno makes bad things happen, oh,
he’s creepy and his vision killed
ma’ goldfish.”

MIRABEL:
I don’t think you make bad things
happen. Sometimes family weirdos
just get a bad rap. You can do
this.

ANTONIO:
(I’ve been there)
For the nerves.

TIO BRUNO:
(to himself)
I can do this. I can do this. I can
do this, I can do this.
You might wanna hang on.
It’s just -- it’s just the same
thing, I gotta stop --

MIRABEL:
No, I need to know which way it
goes -- there’s gotta be an answer,
something we’re not seeing.

TIO BRUNO:
(over the noise)
You’re looking at the same thing
that I am! If there was something
else --

MIRABEL:
(holy shit)
There -- over there --

TIO BRUNO:
Butterfly! Follow the butterfly!

MIRABEL:
Where is that...?

TIO BRUNO:
It’s all outta order --
It’s, it’s -- it’s the candle! The
candle’s getting brighter!
I think you’re gonna help the
candle!

MIRABEL:
How?!

TIO BRUNO:
There’s someone with you! And you -
you fight her!

MIRABEL:
What?!

TIO BRUNO:
Wait no, no, no, no -- is that a
hug?!

MIRABEL:
Am I fighting or hugging?!

TIO BRUNO:
An embrace -- AN EMBRACE! -- to
make the candle bright, you have to
embrace her!!

MIRABEL:
Embrace who?!

TIO BRUNO:
Almost there...

MIRABEL:
Who is it?!

TIO BRUNO:
Almost there... I, I -- I got it!

MIRABEL:
Isabela?!

TIO BRUNO:
Oh, your sister, that’s great!
Every time.

MIRABEL:
Why would “embracing Isabela” do
anything?

TIO BRUNO:
Idaknow, our family got a miracle,
how do you help a family miracle?
You hug a sister.

CAMILO:
(calling out)
Mirabel?! Mirabel?!

TIO BRUNO:
Oh, I think we’re running outta
time here.

MIRABEL:
It’s not gonna work. She won’t hug
me, ever, okay? She hates me. Also,
I don’t know if you heard, I ruined
her proposal. Plus, P.S.--

TIO BRUNO:
-- Mirabel --

MIRABEL:
-- it is just annoying -- of course
it’s Isabela --

TIO BRUNO:
-- Mirabel --

MIRABEL:
-- and what’s her problem with me
anyway, she’s the one with roses
coming out her--

TIO BRUNO:
Mirabel. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry,
you see you’re missing the point.
The fate of the family is not up to
her, it’s up to you. You’re exactly
what this family needs. You just
have to see it.
(then, casual)
By yourself, after I leave.

MIRABEL:
What? You’re not coming?

TIO BRUNO:
(”important prophecy”)
It was your vision, Mirabel... not
mine.

MIRABEL:
You’re afraid Abuela will see you.

TIO BRUNO:
Yep, I mean yes... that too.
(then)
Hey, after you save the miracle...
come visit.

MIRABEL:
(smiles, then)
After I save the miracle, I’m
bringing you home.

TIO BRUNO:
Knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock
on wood.

MIRABEL:
You got this. Just gonna save the
miracle... (SO DUMB) with a hug.

MIRABEL:
(super sweet)
Isa? Hey!
(calling out)
I know we’ve... had our issues...
but I’m... (HATING SAYING IT) ready
to be a better sister... to you...
So we should just... hug... Let’s
hug it out. Eh?

ISABELA:
(menacing)
Hug it out...?
(then)
Luisa can’t lift an empanada.
Mariano’s nose looks like a smashed
papaya. Have you lost your mind?!

MIRABEL:
Isa, I feel like you’re upset...
and you know what cures being
upset? A warm embrace.

ISABELA:
Get out.
Everything was perfect! Abuela was
happy, the family was happy, you
wanna be a better sister, apologize
for ruining my life!
Go on... apologize.

MIRABEL:
(that’s a tough one)
I... am... sorry...
(can’t keep going)
...That your life is so great!

ISABELA:
Out.

MIRABEL:
Wait, fine, “I apologize” -
(the vine tugs her)
I wasn’t trying to ruin your life --
(struggles ungracefully)
Some of us have bigger problems,
you selfish, entitled princess!

ISABELA:
Selfish?! I’ve been stuck being
perfect my whole entire life and
literally the only thing you have
ever done for me is mess things up!

MIRABEL:
Nothing is messed up! You can still
marry that big, dumb hunk

ISABELA:
I NEVER WANTED TO MARRY HIM. I WAS
DOING IT FOR THE FAMILY!!

MIRABEL:
Oh my gosh... Isa... that is a very
serious confession...
(then, stands, deep
breath, not slick,
extends arms)
Okay, get over here, bring it in.
(hello?)
Isa?

ISABELA:
(singing)
I... JUST MADE SOMETHING UNEXPECTED
SOMETHING SHARP
SOMETHING NEW

MIRABEL:
Isa, this is the part where we
(hug) --

ISABELA:
IT’S NOT SYMMETRICAL OR PERFECT BUT
IT’S BEAUTIFUL
AND IT’S MINE...
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

MIRABEL:
Wait!
(then)
BRING IT IN, BRING IT IN
GOOD TALK, BRING IT IN, BRING IT IN
LET’S WALK, BRING IT IN, BRING IT
IN

ISABELA:
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

MIRABEL:
FREE HUGS?! BRING IT IN, BRING IT
IN

ISABELA:
I GROW ROWS AND ROWS OF ROSES
FLOR DE MAYO
BY THE MILE
MAKE PERFECT PRACTICED POSES
SO MUCH HIDES BEHIND MY SMILE
WHAT COULD I DO IF I JUST GREW WHAT
I WAS FEELING IN THE MOMENT?

MIRABEL:
(trying to keep up)
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU’RE GOING?

ISABELA:
WHAT COULD I DO IF I JUST KNEW IT
DIDN’T NEED TO BE PERFECT, IT JUST
NEEDED TO BE? AND THEY LET ME BE?
A HURRICANE OF JACARANDAS
STRANGLING FIGS

MIRABEL:
(dodging)
BIG!

ISABELA:
HANGING VINES

MIRABEL:
(retreating)
This is fine!

ISABELA:
PALMA DE CERA FILLS THE AIR AS I
CLIMB
AND I PUSH THROUGH...
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?
CAN I DELIVER US A RIVER OF SUNDEW?
CAREFUL IT’S CARNIVOROUS, A LITTLE
JUST WON’T DO...
I WANNA FEEL THE SHIVER OF
SOMETHING NEW
I’M SO SICK OF PRETTY
I WANT SOMETHING TRUE, DON’T YOU?

MIRABEL:
YOU JUST SEEM
LIKE YOUR LIFE’S BEEN A DREAM
SINCE THE MOMENT YOU OPENED YOUR
EYES

ISABELA:
WHOOAAAA
HOW FAR DO THESE ROOTS GO DOWN?
WHOAAAAA

MIRABEL:
ALL I KNOW
ARE THE BLOSSOMS YOU GROW
BUT IT’S AWESOME TO SEE HOW YOU
RISE

ISABELA/MIRABEL:
HOW FAR CAN YOU/I RISE?
THROUGH THE ROOF, TO THE SKIES
LET’S GOOO...

ISABELA:
A HURRICANE OF JACARANDAS

MIRABEL:
WHOO!

ISABELA:
STRANGLING FIGS

MIRABEL:
GO!

ISABELA:
HANGING VINES

MIRABEL:
GROW!

ISABELA:
PALMA DE CERA FILLS THE AIR AS I
CLIMB AND I PUSH THROUGH

MIRABEL:
WHAT ELSE, WHAT ELSE?

MIRABEL/ISABELA:
WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN YOU ARE DEEPLY
MADLY TRULY IN THE MOMENT?

MIRABEL:
SEIZE THE MOMENT, KEEP GOIN!

MIRABEL/ISABELA:
WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN YOU KNOW WHO
YOU WANNA BE ISN’T PERFECT

ISABELA:
BUT I’LL STILL BE OKAY...

MIRABEL:
HEY, EVERYBODY CLEAR THE WAY, WOOO!

ISABELA:
I’M COMING THROUGH WITH TABEBUIA...

MIRABEL:
SHE’S COMING THROUGH WITH THAT
BOOYAH!

ISABELA:
MAKING WAVES

MIRABEL:
MAKING WAVES

ISABELA:
CHANGING MINDS...

MIRABEL:
YOU’VE CHANGED MINE—

ISABELA:
THE WAY IS CLEARER ‘CAUSE YOU’RE
HERE AND WELL,
I OWE THIS ALL TO YOU
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

MIRABEL:
SHOW ‘EM WHAT YOU CAN DO!!

ISABELA:
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

MIRABEL:
THERE’S NOTHING YOU CAN’T DO—

ISABELA:
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO!

ISABELA:
(giggling)
You’re a bad influence.

ABUELA ALMA:
What is going on?!

MIRABEL:
(excited)
Abuela!
It’s okay, everything’s -- we’re
gonna save the miracle - the magic -

ABUELA ALMA:
What are you talking about? Look at
our home. Look at your sister!

MIRABEL:
Please, just - Isabela wasn’t happy
and -

ABUELA ALMA:
Of course she isn’t happy, you
ruined her proposal --

MIRABEL:
-- no, no she needed me to ruin her
proposal and then we did all of
this and the candle burned brighter
and the cracks --

ABUELA ALMA:
-- Mirabel --

MIRABEL:
That’s why I’m in the vision, I’m
saving the miracle!

ABUELA ALMA:
You have to stop, Mirabel!
The cracks started with you. Bruno
left because of you. Luisa’s losing
her powers, Isabela’s out of
control, because of you. I don’t
know why you weren’t given a gift,
but it is not an excuse for you to
hurt this family!

MIRABEL:
I will never be good enough for
you. Will I? No matter how hard I
try. No matter how hard any of us tries.
(then)
Luisa will never be strong enough.
Isabela won’t be perfect enough --
Bruno left our family because you
only saw the worst in him--

ABUELA ALMA:
-- Bruno didn’t care about this
family --

MIRABEL:
He loves this family - I love this
family! We all love this family!
You’re the one that doesn’t care!
You’re the one breaking our home!

ABUELA ALMA:
Don’t you ever --!

MIRABEL:
The miracle is dying, because of
you!

PEPA:
No, no, no --

FÉLIX:
The candle!

MIRABEL:
Casita, get me up there!

CAMILO:
No.

FÉLIX:
Careful! Antonio! We gotta get out
of here!

JULIETA:
Mirabel?! Mirabel!

AGUSTÍN:
Mirabel! You have to get out!

JULIETA:
Mirabel!
Mirabel?! Mirabel leave it!

FÉLIX:
Mirabel! The House is gonna fall!

PEPA:
Mirabel! Get out!

AGUSTÍN:
Mirabel!

MIRABEL:
(tiny)
No...

JULIETA:
(like she’s a thousand
miles away)
Mirabel...!
(garbled, through the fog)
Mirabel! Are you hurt? Mirabel?

PEPA:
Julieta! Come quick! Julieta!

JULIETA:
(to Mirabel)
Don’t move. I’ll be right back!

PEPA:
How could this happen?

AGUSTIN:
Everyone okay? Is everyone okay?

DOLORES:
Here, let me help you, let me help
you.

FAMILY WALLA:
Antonio, don’t cry, papito, don’t
cry. / I couldn’t hold it up. / The
Encanto is broken. / What do we do
now? / My powers ... they’re gone!
/ What about Antonio, what is he
gonna do?

JULIETA:
Mirabel? Mirabel!? Where’s Mirabel?
Where is she? Mirabel?!

AGUSTÍN:
MIRABEL! MIRABEL?!

LUISA:
Mirabel! Mirabel!

INNOCENT CECILIA:
They haven’t found her yet?

AGUSTIN:
Mirabel?

JULIETA:
Mirabel?!

FÉLIX:
Mirabel?!

ABUELA ALMA:
(quiet)
Mirabel...

MIRABEL:
(tiny, broken)
I’m sorry. I didn’t want to... hurt
us... I just wanted to... to be
something I’m not...

ABUELA ALMA:
I’ve never been able to... come
back here...
This river... is where we were
given our miracle...

MIRABEL:
Where Abuelo Pedro...

ABUELA ALMA:
I thought we would have a different
life... (INTO V.O.) I thought I
would be a different woman...
I was given a miracle... a second
chance... and I was so afraid to
lose it... that I lost sight of who
our miracle was for.
And... I am so sorry...
...You never hurt our family,
Mirabel. We are broken... Because
of me.

MIRABEL:
Abuela... I can finally see. You
lost your home... lost
everything... you suffered so
much... all alone... so it would
never happen again.
(then)
We were saved because of you. We
were given a miracle because of
you. We are a family because of
you. And nothing could ever be
broken, that we can’t fix...
together.

ABUELA ALMA:
(as they hug)
I asked my Pedro for help.
Mirabel... he sent me you.

TIO BRUNO:
She didn’t do this! She didn’t do
this! I gave her a vision! It was
me! I was like go! And she was like
fttt! She only wanted to help. I...
don’t care what you think of me,
but if you’re too stubborn to, to --

ABUELA ALMA:
(quiet, remorseful)
Brunito...

TIO BRUNO:
I feel like I missed something
important.

MIRABEL:
Come on...

TIO BRUNO:
What - what’s happening, where are
we going?

MIRABEL:
Home.

PUMPED JUANCHO:
It’s her, I FOUND HER!

LITTLE ALEJANDRA:
I found her!

INNOCENT CECILIA:
She’s back, she’s back, she’s back!

JULIETA:
Mirabel?!
Mirabel!

MIRABEL:
(intimate, warm)
Mamá...

JULIETA:
Ay mi amor, I was so worried... we
couldn’t find you.

AGUSTÍN:
(racing up, covered in
welts)
There were bees everywhere.
I’ll be okay.

CAMILO:
Uh... not if we don’t have a house.
(OFF FÉLIX) What? We don’t have a
house, I can’t say we don’t have a
house? What is that? Not a house.

MIRABEL:
LOOK AT THIS HOME
WE NEED A NEW FOUNDATION
IT MAY SEEM HOPELESS
BUT WE’LL GET BY JUST FINE
LOOK AT THIS FAMILY
A GLOWING CONSTELLATION
SO FULL OF STARS
AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO SHINE
BUT THE STARS DON’T SHINE, THEY
BURN
AND THE CONSTELLATIONS SHIFT
I THINK IT’S TIME YOU LEARN
YOU’RE MORE THAN JUST YOUR GIFT...

ABUELA ALMA:
AND I’M SORRY I HELD ON TOO TIGHT,
JUST SO AFRAID I’D LOSE YOU TOO
(ABUELA beckons over the
shadowy figure of Bruno.)
THE MIRACLE IS NOT
SOME MAGIC THAT YOU’VE GOT
THE MIRACLE IS YOU, NOT SOME GIFT,
JUST YOU...

ABUELA/MIRABEL:
THE MIRACLE IS YOU, ALL OF YOU, ALL
OF YOU

CAMILO:
OKAY SO... WE GONNA TALK ABOUT
BRUNO...?

ANTONIO:
(grinning)
That’s Bruno.

TIO BRUNO:
YEAH, THERE’S A LOT TO SAY ABOUT
BRUNO...
(then, grabbing Pepa and
spinning her around)
I’LL START, OKAY!
PEPA I’M SORRY ‘BOUT YOUR WEDDING
DIDN’T MEAN TO BE UPSETTING
THAT WASN’T A PROPHECY I COULD JUST
SEE YOU WERE SWEATING
AND I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOUR BRO LOVES YOU SO
LET IT IN, LET IT OUT, LET IT RAIN,
LET IT SNOW
“LET IT GOOO...”

FÉLIX:
That’s what I’m always saying, Bro!

TIO BRUNO:
I GOT A LOTTA ‘POLOGIES I’VE GOT TO
SAY

JULIETA:
HEY WE’RE JUST HAPPY THAT YOU’RE
HERE, OKAY?

TIO BRUNO:
But --

PEPA:
COME INTO THE LIGHT!

TIO BRUNO:
But --

AGUSTIN:
THE TRIPLETS ALL REUNITE!

JULIETA:
AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

JULIETA/PEPA:
WE’RE GONNA FIND OUR WAY

DOLORES:
(to Camilo)
YO I KNEW HE NEVER LEFT.
I HEARD HIM EVERY DAY...

ABUELA ALMA:
WHAT’S THAT SOUND?

ANTONIO:
I think it’s everyone in town...

TOWNSPEOPLE:
HEY! LAY DOWN YOUR LOAD, LAY DOWN
YOUR LOAD, WE’RE ONLY DOWN THE
ROAD, WE’RE ONLY DOWN THE ROAD, WE
HAVE NO GIFS BUT WE ARE MANY AND
WE’LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU!

ISABELA:
IT’S A DREAM WHEN WE WORK AS A
TEAM. YOU’RE SO STRONG.

LUISA:
YEAH, BUT SOMETIMES I CRY—

ISABELA/MIRABEL:
SO DO I!

LUISA:
I MAY NOT BE AS STRONG,
BUT I’M GETTING WISER

ISABELA:
YEAH, I NEED SUNLIGHT AND
FERTILIZER
C’MON, LET’S PLANT SOMETHING NEW
AND WATCH IT FLY

ISABELA/LUISA:
STRAIGHT UP TO THE SKY,

ISABELA/LUISA/MIRABEL/DOLORES:
LET’S GO...

JULIETA/MIRABEL:
THE STARS DON’T SHINE THEY BURN
THE CONSTELLATIONS GLOW
THE SEASONS CHANGE IN TURN

JULIETA:
WOULD YOU WATCH OUR LITTLE GIRL GO?

AGUSTÍN:
SHE TAKES AFTER YOU.

MIRABEL:
HEY MARIANO, WHY SO BLUE?

MARIANO:
I... JUST HAVE SO MUCH LOVE
INSIDE...

MIRABEL:
Y’KNOW, I’VE GOT THIS COUSIN TOO.
HAVE YOU MET DOLORES?

DOLORES:
OKAY I’LL TAKE IT FROM HERE, G’BYE!
(She turns to Mariano)
YOU TALK SO LOUD.
YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOTHER AND
YOU MAKE HER PROUD.
YOU WRITE YOUR OWN POETRY EVERY
NIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP
AND I’M SIEZING THE MOMENT SO WON’T
YOU WAKE UP AND NOTICE ME

MARIANO:
DOLORES... I SEE YOU

DOLORES:
AND I HEAR YOU.

MIRABEL:
YES!

TOWNSPEOPLE:
ALL OF YOU, ALL OF YOU.

MARIANO:
LET’S GET MARRIED!

DOLORES:
SLOW DOWN.

MIRABEL/ABUELA/TOWNSPEOPLE:
ALL OF YOU, ALL OF YOU.

MIRABEL:
HOME SWEET HOME.
I LIKE THE NEW FOUNDATION.

ABUELA ALMA:
IT ISN’T PERFECT.

MIRABEL:
NEITHER ARE WE.

ABUELA ALMA:
THAT’S TRUE.
JUST ONE MORE THING, BEFORE THE
CELEBRATION.

MIRABEL:
WHAT?

TIO BRUNO:
WE NEED A DOOR-KNOB.

ANTONIO:
WE MADE THIS ONE FOR YOU...

CAMILO/DOLORES/FÉLIX/PEPA:
WE SEE HOW BRIGHT YOU BURN...

LUISA/ISABELA:
WE SEE HOW BRAVE YOU’VE BEEN...

AGUSTÍN/JULIETA:
NOW SEE YOURSELF IN TURN...

TIO BRUNO:
YOU’RE THE REAL GIFT, KID.
LET US IN.

ABUELA ALMA:
OPEN YOUR EYES...
(then, small)
Abre los ojos.... What do you see?

MIRABEL:
I see... me...
(then)
All of me.
Hola, Casita.
C’mon, get in here!

ABUELA ALMA:
Everyone, together.

FAMILY... AND MIRABEL:
La Familia Madrigal!
