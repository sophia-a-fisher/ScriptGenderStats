Snow White: [Spoken] I really feel quite happy now. I’m sure I’ll get along somehow. Everything’s going to be all right. But I do need a place to sleep at night. [Chuckling] I can’t sleep in the ground like you. Or in a tree the way you do. And I’m sure no nest would possibly be big enough for me. Maybe you know where I can stay. In the woods somewhere? You do?
[Twittering] Will you take me there? Oh, it’s adorable. Just like a doll’s house. I like it here. Ooh, it’s dark inside. Guess there’s no one home. [Door Creaking] Hello? May I come in?
Shh. Oh! What a cute little chair. Why, there’s seven little chairs. Must be seven little children. And from the look of this table, seven untidy little children. A pickax. A stocking too. [Laughing] And a shoe. [Astonished Whistle] [Astonished Whistle] And just look at that fireplace. It’s covered with dust. [Squirrel 1 Sneezing] [Squirrel 2 Sneezing] [Squirrel 3 Sneezing] And look, cobwebs everywhere. My, my, my! What a pile of dirty dishes.
[Whistling] [Gasping] And just look at that broom. Tsk, tsk, tsk! Tsk, tsk, tsk! Why, they’ve never swept this room. You’d think their mother would-- [Gasping] Maybe they have no mother. Then, they’re orphans. That’s too bad. I know. We’ll clean the house and surprise them. Then, maybe they’ll let me stay. [Twittering] Now, you wash the dishes. You tidy up the room. You clean the fireplace. And I’ll use the broom. [Twittering Bugle Call] [Twittering Bugle Call] [Sung] Just whistle while you work [Whistling] and cheerfully together we can tidy up the place so hum a merry tune [Humming] it won’t take long when there’s a song to help you set the pace and as you sweep the room imagine that the broom is someone that you love and soon you’ll find you’re dancing to the tune [Spoken] oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub. [Singing Continues] When hearts are high the time will fly so whistle while you work [Spoken] Uh, uh, uh, uh. Not under the rug.
